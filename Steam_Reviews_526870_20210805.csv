Base game Is pretty fun, I've played through it a couple times myself and Id give it like a 7/10.

It is an excellent Factory/Resource Management sim in the same vein as Factorio but in 3D. If you like those types of games, do yourself a favor and pick this one up.

CrusaderBastion,https://steamcommunity.com/id/CrusaderBastion/,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Like Factorio but 3d -- that is, a logistics based game where the point is to mine resources and automate processes to form those resources into productive assets, but in three dimensions. The game is still in Early Access and there's still a ways to go on it but in its current state, its still quite fun (presuming you like logistics, production, and automation). I highly recommend it!

I'm now going to quibble about small things because that's what I do when I like a game: There seems to be a lack of biodiversity in interactable flora and fauna. The end game seems to be almost exclusively about production lines with a lot of great ideas feeling undervalued -- Factorio's bug colonies feel like an appropriate solution, albeit taken (though manning the walls and setting up flame turrets sounds super cool in a game like this). The multiple start zones are just different spots on the same planet and the difficulty levels are misleading (personally, the ""hardest"" ones seem the easiest and vice-versa). Power generation feels.. clunky -- I can produce a huge facility that should double my power production but the spikes in usage and the finickiness of the water pumps take an overly large amount of effort to smooth out. Not a whole lot of point in exploring (which gets back to great ideas feeling underused/wasted -- like, there's some really cool vehicles). Multiplayer continues to have glitches.

All in all, I'm excited to see what they end up doing -- hopefully updates sooner rather than later.",Recommended,1275,277.6 hrs on record,Posted: August 4

This game is truly SATISFACTORY *wink* *wink*. But actually, it's a quite enjoyable game. The creatures are fascinating, I'm thankful for the arachnophobia mode, and the game is easy to just start up and play. It also doesn't require internet! (and if it does, it doesn't require a good signal.) I thought the game was very slow at the toturial segment, but the actual game is quite easy once you have all of your machines set up. It is definitely worth the $20, and I think would be worth it for up to $60!!

After the fun i have been getting with dyson sphere program which 3rd person wider angle, i also now sucked into this other ""logistics base building open world' game early access as well but i find much more my style. Mostly because it actually first person so instead of hovering above you are on the ground, the structures are above you, you have jump climb and parkour around your constructions. For early access is very clean from bugs, lots of hours of game play to do, there is early access PVE but the wildlife is no pushover. This has a very familiar ARK Survival Evolved feel to it the experience within the open world, base building, tech research is very similar but does not appear to be using the ARK engine. Even better you can co op with someone else, so work within the map build out the enviroment. I am going to be playing for sometime methinks.

This game is in early access but the game is relaxing and you get to build cool things. The number of things you need get a little out of hand. Like to make the 500 Smart Plates for the Space Elevator took 16,000 Screws. Maybe shrink that number to half or speed up the default construction rate and lower the times you have to up the progress bar so it doesn't take so long even with automation and manual combined. The game is fantastic and I definitely recommend it.",Recommended,399,29.5 hrs on record,Posted: August 3

Satisfactory is incredibly satisfying for the OCD in me. Plenty of space for creativity and straight up ingenuity.

However!!!
I found the wildlife to be annoying and impractical in relation to the environment. Some have ridiculously unlimited chemical like fireballs and all of them will always attack you. Few predators will attack 100% of the time. Most will always put on a show to avoid conflict for that matter. But these ones come after you fearlessly 100% of the time. All in an effort to guard minerals or crashed drones? The AI needs serious work.

End Thought,
If you add a few smart Mods to this game, you can have hours of endless amusement. So, if you are creative and LOVE to build, but find wildlife and indestructible gas tubes to be annoying. MOD it !",Recommended,656,354.2 hrs on record,Posted: August 2

gamelord12,https://steamcommunity.com/id/gamelord12/,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
I don't want to just compare this game to Factorio, but I feel like I have to. In Factorio, I'm continually expanding my factory, and the way upgrades work steers me toward progressively introducing a new challenge and automating the one that I just solved. In Satisfactory, it feels like I know what I want to do, but the game is trying to stop me from having too much fun right away. All of the resources I need are too far away, I can't passively craft things from my inventory while walking around (like I can in Factorio), power sources are very limited early on in the game, alien enemies and health regen severely limit your ability to explore for the first several hours, and on and on. It leads to a whole lot of waiting around for things to happen, because the game puts too many obstacles in your way in the early game for you to continually automate away that tedium. Maybe it gets better later, or maybe the game just did an exceptionally poor job of steering me toward the right way to play the game, but the sheer act of making a factory in 3D space doesn't make up for the tedium introduced here.",Not Recommended,923,31.7 hrs on record,Posted: July 31

Coffee Stain Studios brings objects alive in a way that I just love. The machinery with all the amazing animations just blows my mind for some reason. I love how interactable all the machines feel and how much control over the whole experience you have. I figured 169.0 hours was a good place to stop and write a review for this amazing game that is still in early access.

I have still not gotten past tier 5 because getting coal power up and running was difficult and time consuming for me. Advancing into steel and other actually complicated recipes is where I kinda got stumped with all the ratios and making sure that I'm making enough of the newest thing that I don't have to wait forever to get the to the next tier. this is where you need to start scaling up to what I find is an intimidating degree.

If I have any negatives about the game it's that the world feels really lonely there isn't a whole lot going on in the world, and I don't mean the world looks bad it's a very pretty alien planet but its pretty much just there to look at. No pollution to worry about no terrain deformation, there is some caves to explore and things to find but it just feels lacking. None of my friends own the game so I'm kind of forced to make my own fun with the game and decide on my own what to work on next. And the big bean creature's animation are a little lacking for me, it kinda folds in on itself at its joint areas and I don't like it, it just seams off compared to all the other creatures. Of witch there are 4 enemies I have come across and 4 passive creatures that I came across. apart from the spiders and lizard doggo they are kind of boring.

There is currently 8 tiers of tech in the game and I believe it will go up to 12 by full release. What they will add to those new tiers though I'm not sure as the game seems to have everything I can think of beyond some expansion to the power like some logic so I can have fun some of the stuff that currently just serves as cosmetic's. they just added drone's, zip lines, some power improvements, lights and a hand full of other things I have yet to get to.

All in all it is a great game so far a solid 8/10 for me I cant wait to spend another 169 hours just moving up two more tiers and I cant wait to see what they will add and that they will change.",Recommended,1877,170.6 hrs on record,Posted: July 29

Who wants a short game. Well, that's not for him.
It can make you very addictive as continuous improvement and rising inventory requirements always force you to grow, which is good in this game!
The discovery and the improvements that can be extracted from the wrecked wreckage can completely rewrite the production of all the factories so far. After 700+ (Epic version) hours of playing time, the development is capable of such a turnaround that it takes an additional 500 hours to rebuild.
And even ""only"" early access. What if the final improvements are included?
(Before the developers and communication down the hat. Weekly live chat with players. All developers and publishers could take examples from the Coffee Stain Team!)
Thanks to them, I haven’t completely lost faith in the dedicated developers.

Aki rövid játékra vágyik.. Nos ez nem neki való.
Nagyon függővé tud tenni, mivel a folyamatos fejlesztés és emelkedő készletszükséglet mindig növekedésre kényszerit, ami ebben a játékban jó! A felfedezés és a lezuhant roncsokból kinyerhető fejlesztések teljesen át tudják irni az egész addigi gyárak termelését. 700+ óra játékidő után képes akkora fordulatra a fejlesztés, hogy további 500 óra kell az átépitéshez.
És még ""csak"" korai hozzáférésü. Mi lesz ha a végleges fejlesztések is bekerülnek?
(A fejlesztők és a kommunikáció előtt le a kalappal. Heti beszélgetés élőben a játékosokkal. Minden fejlesztő és kiadó példát vehetne a Coffee Stain csapatától!)

Huge world, resources, and building some insane things. There is some combat with a few creatures but the game is focused mostly on resources and production of materials. But when you need a break from blueprints go smash some bully-beast faces or find ways to climb nearby structures to rare rewards (slugs).
There is a learning curve and you can find ways to expedite many processes to speed up production. Sometimes it takes time and a *higher view*. Always keep backup storage. It's an amazing game.",Recommended,437,64.1 hrs on record,Posted: July 29

Overall: 4/5
Satisfactory is primarily about automation, ratios, and building, with minor elements of exploration and creative expression.

Gameplay 4/5
When committing to playing a well-done automation factory game, you first have to know what you’re getting yourself into. These games generally involve a lot of math and ratios (although you technically can play without worrying about that much, as I initially did myself). They are also known for being extremely time consuming and addictive; not in a “Haha oh man I played for HOURS” kind of way but more like an “Oh crap it’s 4 in the morning and I forgot to eat dinner” kind of way.
Both Satisfactory and Factorio also have a plethora of well done QoL features that generally put them a tier above most other games in any genre.

Difficulty/Learning Curve 4/5
If you are into this kind of a game, the learning curve is implemented very well and is quite gradual. You slowly build up to a larger and larger scale, in a more multiplicative kind of way rather than an additive way. However, due to some major difficulty jumps that are inevitable in this type of a game (I’m looking at you, crude oil processing), I can’t give it a perfect score.
The game also feels like it deals with by-products a lot more than its counterparts, but that is easily balanced out with the AWESOME-Sink.


Once there is enough content available for an automation game, the replay values become insane. Satisfactory is no exception. At the time of this review, I have 250 hours played, and that’s completely vanilla and mostly singleplayer. I could easily spend another 250+ playing modded or in a multiplayer game if I wanted to, or I could just keep scaling up the desert factory that I’ve already built.


Satisfactory is very visually pleasing and is actually optimized quite well despite having so much for your GPU/CPU to load once your factory grows larger. However, it has been in early access for a few years, so the graphics are oh-so-slightly dated (possibly a design choice to minimize demand on your PC).


Satisfactory has an extremely well done UI that is easy to navigate.
DO NOT SLEEP ON THE TO-DO LIST!!
Also, don’t sleep on the “hit x” feature to open up the encyclopedia.


The control set is pretty standard and will feel familiar to most gamers. Using “c” to crouch/slide felt weird at first, but I got used to it, and it can always be rebound.
There are some minor issues with the controls, such as the hoverpack feeling like it should have a “move in the direction of the crosshair” option.
Crouch sliding constantly to go faster, however, is a very awkward mechanic.
No autorun WHY??


The audio doesn’t stand out as exceptional, but it also doesn’t really fall short. The music is fitting and is quite nice, but isn’t quite as masterful and immersive as say, Astroneer or Divinity’s music.
The machine audio is also really cool, and they do a good job with ADA’s voice, but it’s not the kind of game that I found myself turning the audio, like I did with the aforementioned games.
I would generally be playing the game with a show or video going on in the background, so I wasn’t as interested and invested in the audio or immersion in general.


Early on, the game has an extremely well done atmosphere, and I would have probably given it a 5/5 if it stayed that way.
As you progress, you focus much more on the factory itself and feel less involved with the alien world around you. You can always go exploring, but that is truly a minor part of the game compared to building and automation. This brings a new kind of atmosphere: the atmosphere of the well-oiled and fine-tuned machine (or absolute spaghetti mess) that is your factory.


Unfortunately, Satisfactory’s storyline is currently very underdeveloped, but for very good reasoning. If you start a new game and don’t skip the intro, there is absolutely a story present, but it falls off heavily after that.
My strong personal belief is that this is because story is an absolute bottom tier priority when it comes to automation based games. Having a great story is a welcome addition to any game, but no one is picking up Factorio or Satisfactory and saying “Man, I REALLY loved the creative story writing in that game!” They are almost always talking about the gameplay aspects such as the amazingly well done UI and QoL features, ratios, math, etc.


The combat system is minimal and sub-par. You get a weapon, you dodge enemy attacks if necessary, and you poke them to death. There is a nailgun, but I never really used it.
Combat is a very low priority in a game like this, so in my honest opinion, it is slightly irrelevant when it comes to my overall impressions of the game.
The crafting system on the other hand is very well done.
It can be a little tedious at times, but this is likely a gameplay design intended to discourage hand crafting and encourage automation.
The to-do list and “press x” feature make it much easier to handle.
You cannot automate the production of buildings like you can in Factorio and Dyson Sphere Program. This is an intended gameplay design, but I’m not too sure I’m that big of a fan of it. Either way, it was easy to adjust my playstyle to just having various materials on hand rather than carrying various buildings around with me.


Multiplayer is a ton of fun and implemented quite well, but even the devs have said it is still unfinished and unstable. You will likely run into minor issues here and there, such as visual glitches (like the giant item glitch), desync issues, and items disappearing. Overall it’s done quite well and I’ve hardly had any problems, but they do exist, so I can’t give it a 5/5.
Be sure to adjust network quality settings to the highest possible for all players.


The progression system in this game feels very good, excluding a few difficulty hurdles.
You advance pretty steadily and you can definitely feel that advancement as you move on.
You advance similarly to how you build up: in a more multiplicative way than an additive way.
It does start to feel a bit “grindy” towards the end. Progression definitely slows down more and more as you get into the higher tiers, and it can get to be quite tedious and drawn out in the very late game. This absolutely works for some people, and it worked for me up until the very end of the game, where I simply lost interest because I had essentially unlocked everything.


You have to look for the humor in this type of game to find it; it isn’t right in your face, but similarly to Astroneer, it comes mostly from the hilarious possibilities allowed through the physics system. There are all kinds of things you can do to propel yourself and ragdoll your character or even launch yourself into the atmosphere.
There are also subtle little comedic aspects presented through ADA, some of the tooltips, and the funny writings found inside the HUB.
Most of the machines also have funny names that represent their job.

Despite the non-perfect rating, I would not hesitate one bit to highly recommend this game to anyone who is interested in math, ratios, automation, production, assembly lines, and factory style games. Even if you aren’t a math person, like yours truly, you can easily adjust your playstyle accordingly and find plenty of joy in this game. Maybe it will even help you discover a love or appreciation for numbers that you never knew was there.",Recommended,6151,250.5 hrs on record,Posted: July 28

It's interesting, for quite a while (300 hours in).

But ultimately it's another grinder; make X widgets with a different formula from the last 30 widgets. At the final level, you need to make 4000 of one widget that is produced at a nominal rate of 1 per minute. Trying to scale that up to a reasonable number requires a simply enormous factory; I think I spent about 20 hours building it before I finally decided that it's just not worth the time spent.

It would be a lot better if the game itself, not mods from random sources, had a copy-and-paste function to help build large structures, instead of making the player make hundreds and thousands of individual components and then connecting them with individual cables (for power) and conveyors (for materials).

There's also no way to manage buildings except by going to them and interacting with them directly.

So, fun for a while in the early game, then mostly tedious.",Not Recommended,789,312.1 hrs on record,Posted: July 27

Even if you think it won't in advance, this game will consume your life. All of my discord homies ended up giving in and buying it and spending a ridiculous amount of time in the game almost immediately. This game has made it so that I put off my college classwork until Sunday (the week's work is due every Sunday) every week since I've had it, turning Sunday into a 12+ hour grind in real life to satisfy my multiple hour grinds in-game after work throughout the week.

This is legitimately one of the most addicting games I have gotten my hands on, and I know I have a problem. It hasn't happened yet, but I feel like my housemates are planning an intervention for me. I CAN STOP ANY TIME I WANT OKAY. I just won't.",Recommended,601,90.4 hrs on record,Posted: July 27

TL:DR Summary: If you buy this game it will consume you, as it triggers the same parts of your brain as completing a multi-month hobby project.

Satisfactory...the first game I have ever felt compelled to write a review for. If you are familiar with games like Factorio, Space Engineers, or Dyson Sphere Project, you will have an easier time in your first few hours. Don't worry though, if you are new to this genre, I can not think of a better game to start with. Not necessarily because it's easier than those other games, but because it is by far the most REWARDING.

You begin by choosing a starting location, this is an important choice (ease of building/danger vs. richness of resources) and I would recommend starting in one of the first 2 locations on your first play-through. The nice thing is though, you can visit all of them eventually. The map is HUGE, and I love that no matter where you start, you can end up building in the hardest location later on if you wish. Speaking of the map, WOW, is it gorgeous. You could start in the lush green grassy plains and end up in an unforgiving red canyon hell by the end. There is so much variety to every biome that I was still finding fresh looking areas 30+ hours in. There isn't a lot of variety to the wildlife, but there is enough to keep things interesting.

Moving onto the game-play loop, it starts out simple enough. Mine resources and use those to craft items to craft other things and so on. HOWEVER, it does not stay this stale for very long. Soon you will have automated miners feeding into smelters, which feed into constructors, which build the item resources needed to supply assemblers with 2 different parts to craft another, more complex part. Then you will need to route the end line of this to a SPACE ELEVATOR and send it into orbit. I was in awe with how quickly the scale of my factory grew as I was able to automate more and more of my production...and that's just the first 2 tiers of milestones, there are a total of 8 tiers....and it gets BIG and COMPLEX.

Combat is....meh. Not many things to fight, although what is there provides enough of a challenge. Normally you will find hostile enemies near resources or crash sites (oh yeah btw you can find alternate recipes for items in wrecks...to add to the variety of problem solving tools). You start out with a little taser weapon and can later upgrade that further. There are also a few ranged options, but again, combat is not a focus here.

Graphics are amazing, from the incredible art design for each piece of machinery to the planet itself, eye candy is abundant. What really stood out to me though was the quality of the ANIMATIONS! Wow, some of those animations (like when you first build the space elevator) are insanely impressive.

I'm going to wrap up this review now because I could go on an on, but you should really experience this for yourself. I will end with this though....you can build trains, trucks, buggies, jetpacks, and my fav....HYPERTUBES. There is no end to how creative you can get with your factory.

I cannot believe this is Early Access, best $30 I've ever spent, buy it and lose yourself in the gears of your creation. Also...don't go into caves unprepared :D",Recommended,2671,101.3 hrs on record,Posted: July 27

Part of a fairly small subgenre certainly, but it still stands out as a being utterly fantastic at what it does. The ""factory game"" has always been something I've had a fondness for, and this feels like it being executed with near-AAA scope. It's got a large amount of content and tiers to sort through (Plus more being added), a large world to explore, and a great sense of humour. It being an indie game in early access means what it always means (Plenty of issues), but they have done little to spoil the experience, and some even fit quite well with the game's tone.",Recommended,484,71.6 hrs on record,Posted: July 26

I've been a gamer for over thirty years, and now that I've put in nearly 300 hours in Satisfactory and built everything there is to build, I can safely say it's one of my favorite games of all time. It's easily in my top 5, and considering it's still in early access at the time I'm typing this with many more features and improvements yet to come, that's really saying something.

First, don't look at those screenshots of countless machines and mazes of conveyor belts and pipes and think 'omg, this looks way too complicated for me'. Screenshots like those are not the best representation of the game for new players, and they're almost certainly from the late game (or mid-game at the earliest). You're not gonna be at that point for awhile, and Satisfactory actually does a great job of gradually introducing new builds and concepts to you as you progress. You start off with just a few simple things to build and nothing but a little craft bench to build them with, and as you advance through the tiers, you get more and more new parts, machines, and other stuff unlocked. Then, before you know it, you'll have your first automated assembly line making iron plates and rods.

Make no mistake, this is a game that will make you use your noggin a bit. You don't need to be a genius, but there will be times where you'll need to do some math and calculations to maximize efficiency. A simple example: machine A can produce 60 iron ore per minute, machine B turns 30 iron ore per minute into 30 iron ingots per minute. So how many machine B's will you need to utilize the production capacity of machine A? (Answer is two) :) Questions like this will present themselves regularly as you build and expand, and although it certainly gets more complicated than my example (especially in the mid to late game), you should be fine even if you're only halfway decent at basic arithmetic.

Power is another critical part of the game. With the exception of conveyor belts, your machines don't run on magic - they need electricity or else they're useless chunks of metal. To start with, you're given a weak, primitive means of generating power that cannot be automated, and as you experience your first blown fuse (which happens when your power consumption exceeds your power generating capacity) and/or your first power grid shut down because you haven't manually filled it with fuel in the last twenty minutes, you'll start growing tired of it. :) But good news! The second power source you unlock (and all the others after that) generate way more power and can be 100% automated. In other words, if setup right, it'll generate power for you forever without you ever having to think about or touch it ever again. Complete game changer.

Feel like taking a break from the machines and conveyor belts for a bit? That's perfectly fine! In fact, this is encouraged - there's a beautiful, vast world for you to explore with all kinds of surprises and things to find, many of which will be very helpful later on (if not immediately). Just be careful - there are plenty of hazards out there too. This is one of the great things about this game though - you have complete freedom to do whatever you want whenever you want.

You'll encounter little quirks and bugs once in awhile, but they're all minor and don't detract from the experience. Overall the game is very stable, well-built, and runs just as good, if not better than most games NOT in early access. The game is truly fantastic, and once it comes out of early access, I'm very confident it will get nothing but fantastic reviews from all publications. Just look at the Steam reviews - an astounding 97% are positive, and it's completely deserved - this is an amazing game. It's $30 US, yet it's already far better than most $60 AAA games. Coffee Stain Studios have hit a grand slam here.",Recommended,3175,291.8 hrs on record,Posted: July 25

Good game for playing with friends! We had a lot of fun exploring this planet. Although we did not do much planning, we still managed to build our factory and achieved level 8. And it is very satisfying when looking at what we have done.
But I think there are still some things that can be improved.
1. When driving on elevated roads, I always feel like encountering invisible speed bumps.
2. When your vehicle is behaving strangely, you'd better get out, otherwise you may cross the ground and fall.(This usually means death)",Recommended,455,107.0 hrs on record,Posted: July 25

This game is great! Well structured, yet completely open world and free. The amount of creativity you can express in this platform is just gorgeous. I'm so glad I took the plunge on this early access because it has been enjoyable watching the team develop new crafting methods and watching the directions they go with it. You can either be messy and have a sprawling factory tangle or you can dive in and use custom foundations and walls to build up organized factory complexes. One hing that I personally would love to see is more unlockable walls, foundations, and support styles through the sync. Also adding a bit more variation in the ""wildlife"" would be swell, tho I'm sure that with all the other mechanics going on that would be difficult given functionality.

SATISFACTORY (genre: factory building)
SCORE: 9/10 (COULD BE HIGHER! UP TO 9.5)
This game is great and you could see this in other reviews as well but the games is still lacking things.
-1st thing, the Production Speed is still IMO, not that fantastic, but it could be based on my personal preference. For me if the production and manufacturing got sped up by 25% I would have been addictive to it.
-2nd thing, the conveyor system is still buggy and can be dug into the ground but it is not a big of a problem for me.
-3rd thing, the power system is not 100% polished and solely based on using products, should add Solar Panels or Wind Turbines in the future.
-4th thing, THE GAME HAVE SO MANY POTENTIAL TO EXPAND EVEN MORE WITH SUCH RESPONSIVE DEVELOPERS team and even though the game is pretty fun right now but imagine this:
*Adding a better economy/trading system in the games, for example building computer rigs to ""mine"" crypto currencies, the unified currencies of trans solar civilization to trade. Or even to push it further, to have a trans galactic economy system which you could invest in different galactic companies, etc. Holly s* I would be addict to this game if it did have it.
*The planet is beautiful and fun to explore, but not so fun anymore after you've spent sometimes exploring it as it became cliche natural world. Imagine every single planets or areas having their own characteristic to push the players to explore even more. For example, having an outrageous high mountainous areas which reward the players exploring it by finding a cave full of exotic materials near the top of the highest mountain, or slaying Alien Dragons living in the caves for exotic drops. Also adding Giant Alien Beasts with its nest deep in the forest, etc. And trading the rewards getting from slaying such beasts would reward the players greatly. I have saw Coffee Stain having experience in games like Deep Rock Galactic too and IMO, the games could thrive further on the mechanism of exploring and getting rewards from slaying different alien beasts mechanism
*Or even have smart aliens society which are living in their own little settlement or village who would trade with exotic stuffs for your technology.
*This game have so much potential in multiplayer too, having laughed my A* out when I saw my friends screamed at the top of his lungs when he was attacked by those terrifying cave spiders, and you could add many different things in future for the players to mess around, like different clothing, personal gadgets, even more furniture, wall designs, toys, or even board games and billiards for the players in the same server could play with each others.
*I would say as many other players have suggested this idea too, you could even expand the game to space by adding space ships, etc. but for me, I wouldn't push it, because many other games have done this too, and i don't want to lost all of the current characteristic and charm of this game by changing it that way. Those game thrived on player travelling different planets and their planet is very unrealistically small and not complex, but seriously, one planet is way too big already and you could still expand the world on it and I will respect you for being different.
In Conclusion: this game is near 90% polished and could add so many things into the game in the future as it is still in Early Access (The New Oldest Trick in the book huh?) And I am expecting so much more from it.",Recommended,2877,13.0 hrs on record,Posted: July 23

This game was pretty much exactly what I wanted out of it. If you wanted a 1st person factorio with decent graphics this is about as good as its going to get. The constant growth of production chains into more materials is never ending, and even with 45 hours in one game I have yet to even get to some of the mid-higher end items. Creating massive production lines drawing from resources across the map all to a single place to create one single item feels pretty gratifying, and the game definately adds enough customization and choices in how you build your factory to make it truly unique. The map is also big, really big, and pretty diverse so its actually pretty enjoyable to explore. Definitely going to sink many more hours into this game. 10/10",Recommended,636,93.4 hrs on record,Posted: July 23

Unfortunately I can't recommend this game due to the lack of a blueprint / copy+paste ability. Without this, later stages of factory building are very tedious since every building and every connection has to be placed manually. I pushed through it to complete the final milestone, but it was a real slog and I don't have much desire to play again. The endless mouse clicking saps the fun from factory design. The devs have made it clear on the forums that they will not implement this, so this isn't an Early Access issue. Such a shame.",Not Recommended,459,170.7 hrs on record,Posted: July 21

Pros:
-good graphics
-well designed maps, beautiful + no out of place clipping etc.
-amazing game play, especially if you're mechanically inclined.
-very easy to setup multiplayer, was able to jump right in with no issues.
-no major bugs or glitches that I've had to experience yet.

Cons:
-not very many different maps, which I would assume can cause game play to eventually stagnate. [Edit] At the time of making this I didn't realize there was only one map. But I see now that it is a large single map, with many possibilities. So if it's a negative or not is in the eye of the beholder.

Maybe could add variants of ore etc. to add a splash of variation to the game, but other than that I can't think of anything I dislike.

Overall, I think this game provides a mechanically/statistically challenging environment in a way that still offers the relaxation and entertainment of playing a video game you enjoy. Would definitely recommend. 8.5/10",Recommended,810,22.5 hrs on record,Posted: July 21

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Satisfactory is a game where you build factories. (no duh)
Start by mining your resources by hand, then get portable miners to help speed up that process

Sidenote:
I was - Honestly - stunned how good this game looks.
if you don't like factory building or maybe you need a break from it

just explore the beautiful, absolutely gorgeous world.
(I cannot think of enough adjectives to describe this game)
And my 2yo. laptop had barely a problem running it.
At standard graphics settings I got about 40-60 fps

(just a bit jittery though so I turned the shadow
and post-processing quality to high instead of ultra)

Eventually unlocking Miners, Constructors, Smelters
& Conveyor belts to automate your work for you.

Each building has it's own production rates and resource requirements,
Necessitating good Multiplication, Division and Addition skills.

I personally, recommend you to try to achieve maximum efficiency in your buildings.
Not only because I like math
As that will ensure you get as much done as an overproducing factory setup,
But without the increased power consumption with virtually no benefit.
(and more than an under producing factory, obviously)

I've only gotten to tiers 5 or 6 in about 50h
(idk, MeMoRy BaD)
But even with the slow progression I still had lots of fun

I'm hooked on this game lol
Like all my favorite things in one
Space, Math, g-game uh... yummy sounds?

Also there's a not-so hidden easter egg with the Somersloops or mercer spheres...
where if you stand near it for a long enough time you will hear as ADA tries harder and harder
to convince you to pick it up.
Maybe not game changing but, I thought i'd bring it up.
if you want you can try it for yourself. remember you'll need to stand there for about 3-4 minutes to get all the voice lines
You will hear some weird distorted audio that sounds like the vowel A right before she starts to speak.

I keep making fun new discoveries late in the game about stuff I could have been using the entire time!!

At the time of this review I have finished tiers 6 & 7 and the game is still in early access. My review goes over what I have experienced so some information about the game might not have been available to me. Additionally, the review contains spoilers so read at your own risk:

Satisfactory is the sort of game that at a glance would make you think that it's pretty fun and you wouldn't be wrong to think that. The game features 8 tiers of new and upgraded items, buildings, vehicles and more to help expand your forever-growing factory at the expense of the amount of hours you pour into the game.
What's great about the game is that it's a genre that isn't as popular as your average FPS, Battle Royale or RPG so it was something that peaked my interest straight away (Take into consideration that I've never played another factory game such as Factorio).

A couple hours into the game I was still experiencing new features such as it's pretty large yet lacking map - I chose the grass fields as my starting point due to my first time playing the game: the main reasons of exploring the map are for hard drives unlocking alternate crafting recipes, resources like coal and water (mid-game) for more power, power slugs to boost your factory production however not always efficiency and maybe even leaves if you haven't progressed that far. This may seem like a lot at first but really isn't after going out of your way to get more power slugs for the 80th time. To combat how boring that may become, you are faced with 4 types of creatures: charging dogs, dogs that shoots fireballs (other variants shoot some blue stuff), rotund larvae with wings that emerge from plants and creepy spiders who are by far the scariest to run away from. They all have their mini-boss forms as well which aren't any harder, they just have one extra attack and have more health.

Now for the factory itself, the game's selling point. To progress through the game you must build from resources scattered around the map to manufacture products such as iron rods, screws, copper wire and a whole lot more. As ADA mentions at the start of the game, your objective is to be as efficient as possible and to not waste; in order to do this you must calculate EVERYTHING so that you don't overproduce or underproduce which can cause products to take 100x longer to make. Watching Youtube videos on how to make your factory more efficient is just a waste of money, you might as well not play the game if you're just going to copy someone else. Making mistakes with your placements could potentially mean you have to rebuild your entire factory which sounds like a real pain in the ass because it is. For this reason alone, I wouldn't like to spend more time playing this game just so I can watch more products being made.

In conclusion: This game is fun for the first 30-40 hours but then can get repetitive for most people unless you're into building factories (once again, if you enjoyed or liked factorio then this game is probably for you). I wish to see future updates that improve the amount of content in this game and potentially more features to make the game fun for a wider variety of people. I'll still recommend this game but I wouldn't recommend paying full price right now unless you're confident with the game as it is in its current state or unless you're able to trust the developers of the game to make a good finished game. Personally, I believe Coffee Stain Studios are amazing developers after seeing and playing their other games such as Valheim, Goat Simulator and Sanctum 2.",Recommended,2956,50.1 hrs on record,Posted: July 21

I am probably one of the few who hasn’t played Factorio first. Needless to say I will have to give it a go. I am in love with this game style now, finding myself looking at all similar games.

As my number of hours played might suggest, I love this game. Tons of replay value. Play vanilla first, but it has some great mods too (and great websites to help). Devs continue making updates to ensure mod support along with their content updates.

You can play a number of different ways - go big fast, focus aesthetics to make a nice looking factory, go exploring, etc. The world is beautiful and varied.

Satisfactory is a game about making a factory. The game keeps you reeled in using the world and the gameplay combine together greatly. The graphics are great, better than most factory games I've played. The animals in this game are also fun and hilarious to me. I found this game through the YouTuber ""Let's Game It Out"" and I've never been happier with my purchase. I haven't even reached the midpoint of the game, but in the past 11 hours I've played, I can tell it's ana amazing game. If you play a lot of tycoon/factory/simulator games I recommend you try this one, as it stands out from the crowd in a good way, even if it's still not completely a finished product.",Recommended,566,13.2 hrs on record,Posted: July 21

Best Open-World game ever to make our best factory in the world.

Satisfactory like The Sim or Sim City but you have to explore the world and make your own creativity,

You feel satisfaction while looking all your machines produce all the item recipe.

Make sure you have electricity power enough to supply all your machines or fuse will broke.

Its simple if you have power backup grid, but if you don't, you have to switch up all your power slowly by switch off all your machines power.

Map is very large, unique and beautiful to explore. I just explored 3/20 of the map and it has large enough for me.

All building animation looks good, even train itself while docking and braking system like realistic.

kinda addicted to the game and really enjoy to make it fully automated.

co-op/online multiplayer looks good when you want to build factory together with your friend.

I recommend this game to all who love to play open-world factory game/building simulator.",Recommended,828,152.0 hrs on record,Posted: July 21

This may very well be the best game I’ve ever played. Games like this one very rare. I love the concept and execution of the concept of this game. I’ve never left a review for a game before, but this one definitely deserves nothing but positive reviews. I am looking forward anxiously for Update 5. Until then here are my only two suggestions: 1. Make mass building easier. I am currently working on a mega base (75x75 for the base layer) and it took nearly 5 hours just to do the first level. I then installed the SMART mod and it took only 10 seconds to build what before took hours. I think that a change like this would make building less of an obstacle. As the game currently is, building is a hugely unnecessary obstacle for building massive factories. 2. Add a second body slot. Constantly changing between jetpack, blade runners, gas mask, and soon hover pack is excessively aggravating. Body slots are the one thing in the game that never improve, change, or get better. What you start with is what you get.

Overall, despite the two very annoying things I meantioned (which i fixed with mods anyway so it’s fine) I couldn’t reccomend this game enough to anyone who loves open world, building, survival style games. Or anyone who wants to try something new!",Recommended,1059,80.9 hrs on record,Posted: July 20

The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race. They have greatly increased the life-expectancy of those of us who live in “advanced” countries, but they have destabilized society, have made life unfulfilling, have subjected human beings to indignities, have led to widespread psychological suffering (in the Third World to physical suffering as well) and have inflicted severe damage on the natural world. The continued development of technology will worsen the situation. It will certainly subject human being to greater indignities and inflict greater damage on the natural world, it will probably lead to greater social disruption and psychological suffering, and it may lead to increased physical suffering even in “advanced” countries. The industrial-technological system may survive or it may break down. If it survives, it MAY eventually achieve a low level of physical and psychological suffering, but only after passing through a long and very painful period of adjustment and only at the cost of permanently reducing human beings and many other living organisms to engineered products and mere cogs in the social machine. Furthermore, if the system survives, the consequences will be inevitable: There is no way of reforming or modifying the system so as to prevent it from depriving people of dignity and autonomy. If the system breaks down the consequences will still be very painful. But the bigger the system grows the more disastrous the results of its breakdown will be, so if it is to break down it had best break down sooner rather than later. We therefore advocate a revolution against the industrial system. This revolution may or may not make use of violence; it may be sudden or it may be a relatively gradual process spanning a few decades. We can’t predict any of that. But we do outline in a very general way the measures that those who hate the industrial system should take in order to prepare the way for a revolution against that form of society. This is not to be a POLITICAL revolution. Its object will be to overthrow not governments but the economic and technological basis of the present society. In this article we give attention to only some of the negative developments that have grown out of the industrial-technological system. Other such developments we mention only briefly or ignore altogether. This does not mean that we regard these other developments as unimportant. For practical reasons we have to confine our discussion to areas that have received insufficient public attention or in which we have something new to say. For example, since there are well-developed environmental and wilderness movements, we have written very little about environmental degradation or the destruction of wild nature, even though we consider these to be highly important.

YOU THINK I CALLED OTHER GAMES CRACK? TO BAD, we've found the refined version of that crack. This is 10x stronger than the other crack i showed you. if you've ever played a good factory sim game before, you know how it is, its as simple as no more sleep for you. Have school/work tomorrow and need to wake up early? why not just stop waking up? just play this game instead of sleep, because its simple, you don't need any of that crazy stuff ""normies"" have, just play this game instead.

It's the most addictive, brain-teaser and awe-inspiring base building game I've played! I can easily play this game until 2 AM, it's so satisfying (no, really) to see your factory grow from basically nothing. I love the creative features of the game, like the flying manta ray and her puppies, or the giant potato-like buddy that comes to check out new parts of your base. The landscapes are insanely beautiful, I love the pink forest and the waterfalls the most.

A bit of advice: if there's anything that looks like a green cloud of fart, STAY AWAY. It's radiation and you'll lose health! The neatest feature of the game is taming the , who bring you awesome gifts like caterium, power slugs or SAM ore in exchange for head rubs and raspberries.

I've been wanting this game forever, and it does not disappoint! I keep restarting my factory after I've thought of a new, more efficient way of saving space while maximising resources.

I'm not a fan of early access but I'm a huge fan of automation and crafting games. For that crafting and automation itch this game is more than satisfactory. Every time there is a major update I cant wait to start all over again just to see how the new stuff feels. This game is fun solo and fun in co op multiplayer. This game is compared a lot to factorio which yes if you liked factorio you will probably like this. The enemies in this game are not a complex hive mind to defeat most of them are guarding resources and its usually simple hack and slash while running backwards. If you were like me and were expecting a randomized world it is not but the terrain that was created has a lot of fun and challenging obstacles which can usually be handled more than one way. The graphics to this game are great and can run beautifully on some fairly basic computers.

yamyatos,https://steamcommunity.com/id/yamyatos/,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Satisfactory is not a bad game. But i sure as hell can not recommend it. The high ratings puzzle me. The game is tedious, frustrating and feels like it intentionally slows you down a lot of the time. I'm a big factory building fan, so it's not a problem with the genre. There is a difference between spending 50 hours in Factorio, designing a modular nuclear reactor you can re-use over and over, or spending 50 hours in Satisfactory just placing down stuff manually. For a game about automation, Satisfactory consists of mostly all manual effort.

Factory Building:
A lot of convenient objects and features are missing. No signs to label things. No GUI overlay to help identify which constructor produces what. No junctions for hypertubes. Sorting is not available early-game. No Logic. A lot of little, important things like that. You cant even limit how many items go into a container. Gotta fill the other slots with sticks and stones if you want some additional stacks, but then forget about connecting that container to a belt in the future.
I'm not a fan of clipping objects. ""Belt too steep"" or ""Belt has an invalid shape"" are common things to read. So why is it okay for belts to literally clip through each other? This is not an exploit either, simply the default behavior. It causes real problems as well. Sometimes you place things that appear perfectly connected, just to later notice they are not working because the belt goes from A to B while your merger just sits at the perfect location, but attached to the ground instead, with the belt clipping right through it.
And monorail track placement gives me nightmares.


There are basically no convenience features. Nothing you can do to speed up building stuff. Blueprints would be really helpful. But at the very least give us to speed up building. Need a 100x100 concrete platform? That's 10.000 individual object placements and there is nothing you can do about that. Remember this is a factory building game. This is not an exaggerated example.

Let me just name one more example for how problematic this is. A single MK5 belt can transport 780 items per minute. Say we wanted to turn that into iron rods, which happens at a rate of 15 per minute per constructor. That is 780/15 = 52 constructors. Together with about the same amount of splitters, and mergers, a couple douzen power poles or so, and of course the belts to connect it all. Each of which is to be placed manually. But that's not all. The recipe for each individual constructor has to be set individually, inside the GUI of the corresponding constructor. Not just that; every single power line connecting any power poles or consumers, has to be placed manually as well. Every. Single. Powerline. Let that sink in please.


Animations are mostly well done, but pretty long. Usually this is not a problem, except when it is. Loading or unloading a train? That's 25 seconds each. Drones are even worse. But that's fine as those are meant for long distances anyways. What's not fine is that these animations actively lock up the stations. While loading a train, a station does not accept items. While unloading a train, a station does not output items. This seriously messes with calculations. The only proper way to guarantee a constant output is using a container as buffer, which effectively halves the output ports, thus doubles train length and with that the amount of stations required. Did i mention how huge these are? The 100x100 platform example was not an exaggeration, but an understatement.


There is only one map, with four spawns. To be fair the map is quite large and definitely beautiful. This still heavily reduces replay value tho. The ressource distribution, unless randomized, is also questionable. We only had normal and impure ressources around our spawn, leading us to believe pure ressources were quite rare - which would make sense. We then later found huge clusters of pure ressource nodes close to each other. Using boosters on those, they are basically easily enough to fill all your needs - and we are talking about quite a large factory already.
A lot of the problems i have with this game feel like they are intended to slow the player down. Which may be related to just having one single finite map. My biggest complaint about the map however, or rather minimap, is how you . I mean, cmon? There is a huge satisfaction in seeing your factory grow on a global scale, covering large parts of the map. But there is also practical use to this, for planning where train tracks may end, or seeing in a distance where you would connect things together and so on. None of that is possible.


Expect to run . Our starting base A and our later main base B was separated by a good 10 minutes of walking, on a flat and mostly straight path we build for that purpose over the ocean.
We later connected most of the important locations using hypertubes. Using entrances as boosters (likely not intened but fun), you can reach ridiculous speeds and cover the same distance in 20-30 seconds. So what about some place C in the middle? There are no official hypertube junctions. Cmon, who implements a tube network without thinking about junctions? I managed to work something out, but considering how bad high speeds already work in multiplayer, proper junctions shouldnt be an afterthought.


Vehicles suffer from several problems. They are slow, considering the distances. For automation this is fine, for personal travel it's not. Some of them handle extremely unwell. I managed to 180° nose-flip the 6-wheel 10-ton-looking Truck on a flat road with low speeds by hitting a pebble.
Trains were one of my biggest disappointment. With 120 kmh they are the fastest ground based vehicles. For personal travel to feel enjoyable you may as well double that tho. But that's not why they are disappointing to use. Steering is - or rather how you cant do that. Yeah, you read right. In order to change directions you have to brake the train to a full stop, get out of it, manually pull a lever which spawns on junctions to switch ""default directions"", get back into the train and accelerate again. The animations for accelerating and braking are nice, but it takes soo much time to do so. And as such it is insanely impractical to use trains for anything except a pre-setup path from A to B. The autopilot does not care about the levers, so they basically only exist to annoy and discorage players. Who in their right mind thought this was a good idea?


Let's ignore hand-slots as those are mostly for combat. There is . In this slot you can either equip your ""running shoes"", jetpack, gas mask or hazmat suit. Did i mention how slow travelling feels? Wouldnt it be nice to have faster movement speed while also being able to slightly float upwards? Or not suffocate in the poison gas covering half the map? Or not die of radiation poisoning when you run past uranium? Every time you encounter one of these situations you have to switch out your current equipment. Which also means you have to carry them all around. Let us combine them. Or give us at least 2 body slots. It's not like these items are OP either. The jetpack only covers a couple vertical meters and needs fuel. The gas mask requires filters, and so on.


Performance is not the best, could be worse tho. Autosaves, once your factory grew enough, just completely freeze the game for a second or two every five minutes. Game crashed a hand full of times in our playthrough. Multiplayer has certain problems, but considering everything else works decent.

This game is a first person version of factorio with some slight differences, the graphics are very very nice, its awesome to see all of the different components and parts speedly rush down a conveyor as you try to work out the best way to get 100% efficiency, this is a really fun game both single and multiplayer for people who enjoy games with automation and i would say it has some puzzle solving elements to it trying to figure out the best combination to get the best efficiency, the basic story is you are a FICSIT employee who has landed on a unknown planet, you are tasked with creating a factory to create parts for a space elevator, as you progress the parts become more complex and you have to venture into deeper and more hostile territory, a nice feature i like is the arachnophobia mode which will turn the spider like creatures into cats which are much more pleasing to look at but it is sad to kill them. I would recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a nice relaxing automation game thats like factorio but with much better graphics and in the first person. Unlike factorio you do not have to defend your base from alien invaders but who knows this may change in the future as the game is still being updated by the developers.",Recommended,1042,104.7 hrs on record,Posted: July 17

Great factory game from the viewpoint first person. When you start you feel the need to mine like you would in normal survival but immediately you begin advancements that are all about automation and optimization. The recipes get more complex and the grind needed to advance also increases but so do your choices of automation. The game really opens up when you get your power system automated which allows you more time to explore the very large map.

At the time of writing I have 65 hours of game play and expect that number to hit 100+ in no time at all now that I am trying to complete the final challenges of tech 7 and 8 along with the final elevator mission for early access.",Recommended,577,84.1 hrs on record,Posted: July 17

The biggest issue with the game is that it lacks scarcity, resources never truly run out and trading doesn't exist either. There aren't any real threats and figuring out what is producing what is also difficult as well. It's a very straightforward game, a little too straightforward for the type of game it wants to be.

Most people run when they hear Early Access but I have conplete faith this game will be completed.

The discord for the game is active and the Devs often do a twitch stream that is open to questions. They update you on the progress being made and what will come in future updates. The updates offer lots of new content to an already amazing game. The devs take bugs seriously and work to fix them quickly.
The gameplay is addictive and well thought out with good progression. Graphics look pretty good and the gameplay works well for me. It has a simple goal with an infinite amount of possibilities.

Warning there are some weird alien type creatures that roam the planet, some of them make me uncomfortable so if youre bothered easily by those types of things please research them and get familiar before you get the game.

This game will continue to be worked on and will see a full release once the amazing team of devs consider it ready. It deserves a chance and if you don't like it then you can always refund it

It deserves a solid 8.75/10",Recommended,879,19.3 hrs on record,Posted: July 15

So, like, someone took cracktorio and made it more addictive by casting it into 3D.

This is a competent game in progress. It has a long way to go, but if, like me, you are/were addicted to Factorio, you will find this experience Satisfactory.

It clearly has a long way to go, so don't buy it if you want a smooth, polished experience. But it's entirely playable and highly enjoyable. I'm 15 hours into my second attempt and all I want to do is start over because I know so much! But instead, I just unhook old base, start new base ... OMG this one is going to be 4 levels high!

I don't understand why this game got so popular.

I guess there are people in the world that believe ""game"" includes performing a trivial task repeatedly without any chance of failure or obstacle to overcome.

For me, I want to fail, I want to be challenged, I want my neurons to fire. The only challenge in this game seems to be the calculation of fractions when you figure the output of one machine and the input of another. Hell, that is barely even there, since most people just use an online tool to do that calculation for them. At any rate, I mastered that skill in second grade, 36 years ago. Your mileage may vary depending on your education system.

I suppose you could build things to be pleasing to the eye, and line it all up with right angles or multiple floors vertically, but why would you? No one is going to see it.

Other than that, I found myself, simply building the same thing, as needed, over and over and over again, with no purpose, no obstacle, and no challenge. The game doesn't even let you save a blueprint, so once you spend three hours lining everything up for item X, you have to do it all over again in another spot when you need more of item X.

It isn't possible to lose at all, and that's a huge turn off for me. It's an exercise of how many times I can do the same thing over hours until boredom prevents me from playing anymore.

I enjoyed Factorio quite a bit more, simply because there was opposition and the possibility of losing. In Satisfactory, both resources and time are infinite. This truly is a game for people to turn off their brains. I want to exercise mine.

Excellent fun for those who like to gather and build. The critters are not overly challenging. The spiders are appropriately creepy. The critters stay gone once vanquished. The rifle is underpowered. I did not find anything too onerous. Once I set out to do a project, I was able to complete it. I am confused by the world edges, as some you fall off, and others hurt you, while another just kills you immediately.

Initially wasn't all that into it. I will say the tutorial can be a bit overwhelming and could be better, plus starting out can be tricky at first. Eventually though you get the hang of it and it just clicks. From what I have heard its like a first person Factorio (which is a game I haven't played yet as of writing of this review) which I can't attest to how accurate that assessment is. Try to get friends who already have and played this game to help you guide through it. After which the single player is just as good as multiplayer, you just get more help in multiplayer of course. Overall, not a bad early access game, which surprises me why it hasn't officially release yet since it actually functions well for the most part and has a lot of content already.",Recommended,641,113.0 hrs on record,Posted: July 14

This is one of my favourites I still play it from time to time, I just have minor lag issues which will hopefully fixed in the future since it is still in early access.

With all the content they have released so far it is still playable. This game is basically a 3D version of factorio with better graphics. To make the game much better make sure to get SMM (Satisfactory Mod Manager), trust me it add more content that will make your factory look amazing. I have built giant factories with the help of mods.

Playing with only Vanilla items will take up a lot of your time and your factory may not look neat. The modding community is still very active and will help you out on there discord channel:

This is the best game I have ever played.

I have almost 10 hours on this game and can say a lot about the game so lets start with the best it is a factory survival game on an alien planet however things like food and water are not required unless taking damage by enemies so its very laid back and focuses purely on you engineering absolutely insane factories. the graphics are pretty and the entire landscape is extremely unique, the spec requirements are very low, the game has its bugs but is in beta cost 29.99 and outperforms leading triple A games in entertainment, based on how the games going now theres easily 40-50 hours of base game content for first time players.

The only major cons of the game are its still beta so it has its bugs from clipping terrain to wonky conveyor belts sometimes the visuals are definitely lacking, another massive con is because this game has no other NPCS except for an AI female voice it gets boring normally you would just play multiplayer however after you start getting into the point of coal which is a very early stage the game becomes very buggy in multiplayer so long hours are not something i really see myself doing however if you do just enjoy engineering factories solo thats cool.

Id personally recommend this game to anybody in the market for something new the best deal your gonna get is 23.99 on sale so just pay full price and support the devs you will learn quickly that 6$ was much better spent on this game rather then a big mac :)",Recommended,1207,14.0 hrs on record,Posted: July 13

The game is still incomplete, yet it feels so polished and well-made. Every update brings unique new things and adds a lot of hours to exploration and progressing your factory. The system is very well-made and structurally good as a progression system, and it's very rewarding. The replay-ability is endless, because you can play the game in many different ways, go about things in different ways, you can also make a lot of different factories with different structures the game offers you.

There are different maps, they are all very well designed. Graphics are amazing as well as performance. I also haven't found any major / game breaking bugs that make the game unplayable or straight up broken to the point it's not fun.

Multiplayer is not flawless but really fun together. All around it's a really great game, it has enough combat which is challenging but not overpowering, the progression feels very rewarding and even starting over isn't a big deal because of the variety in things you can do and how you can go about stuff.

I guess you could say that Satisfactory is indeed satisfactory, 9/10, would definitely recommend.",Recommended,964,22.6 hrs on record,Posted: July 13

As a Factorio veteran this game gets an easy recommendation from me. Although I want to say that the emphasis with Satisfactory is on a different part of the factory building experience. Whereas Factorio rewards and almost requires laying out your entire base towards efficient mass-production, Satisfactory is more open towards more relaxed styles of play and building. Veterans may still want to build a single massive mega-factory with all resources coming in on one side to produce every possible product in the game on a main bus system. But at least for a first playthrough I have found it to be very enjoyable to place individual and disjoint factory buildings all over the place, producing individual products where convenient to then later collect them when needed or automate their transport. The foundation, wall and walkway options provided make it possible to create very beautiful factory buildings that nestle into the varied and rugged terrain. Planning and filling out a new factory building is always immensely satisfying for me as it all comes from nothing into a sleek and well-organized production setup.

Unlocking new technologies is paced well and drives forward the process of expansion. Exploration takes more time than in Factorio but feels really great thanks to the beautiful landscapes. Barriers like destructible rock and gas clouds will impede progress until you can build the countermeasures. Finding and exploiting a new resource site will have a big impact and let you advance technologically. Finally, there is always room to automate more and to further increase production of needed resources.

Honestly the only disappointment I had with the game is that there are so few ways to change the natural environment to clear the way for a megafactory. The world is handcrafted and hills can't be flattened to create a flat plain to build your factory on. Hence why it's mostly easier to build smaller separate factories. I like that playstyle very well, but I wish there was the option to just build it all in one place like with Factorio. That being said I have only played on the first map, maybe others have more open space available. The alternative is of course for the player to build a giant platform in the sky suspended on pillars to be their artificial flat factory floor. For me that option has proven a bit too silly to actually implement.",Recommended,2008,55.8 hrs on record,Posted: July 13

Let's game it out on YouTube motivated me to get back into this. That's when I realized that update four had come out. I hopped on the game and got really into it. I got my girlfriend to download it and after the first few hours we got off and got ready for bed. Then she told me, ""I hate to say it, but it is fun and I enjoyed it. I will play more tomorrow.""

This game took me by surprise.

I was debating on getting this or Factorio and well this one hooked me greatly because seeing your huge factory in this game is very fulfilling.

The game isn't complex in any way near the start so it's easy to ease into all of the mechanics and next thing you know you're building a super factory and a bunch of mini factories around the world of the game.

It can get a little laggy and buggy with friends but that's okay.

I'd recommend if you like seeing things grow and if you have friends it's even better as it's very cooperative.",Recommended,485,83.3 hrs on record,Posted: July 12

Overall Statement
I have played this game in multiplayer with a friend and we are having tonnes of fun. I can say for sure that I would recommend this game to all of my friends, not just because it's a great game, but because I feel like it would be even more fun with more people to play with.

















This game is brilliant and I definitely recommend it to everyone, and It's only not a 10/10 because of some issues, but the gameplay overall is 10/10. Hopefully some of these issues are fixed with the full release!!!",Recommended,472,81.8 hrs on record,Posted: July 12

I love this game. The devs are hilarious. The game is beautiful. Every time something gets updated I'm so hype.
Ok, hype out of the way. This game is really fun if you like to build and automate things. I used to play minecraft mods like IC2 and this is like that to the max. If you're like me you'll remake your base a million times just trying to make it efficient only to look on reddit and realize people are building beautiful gigantic... factories!

Pros: Beautiful world/building aesthetic, fun progression/exploration, lots of creative freedom

Cons: Currently lacking in enemy types, but the devs said they're working on it.

At the 40 hour mark, this game became so mind numbingly tedious that it became unenjoyable. I hope you enjoy spending literal days trying to unlock the rest of the gameplay with the world's most boring and painful grind because thats what you're going to get.

It took 5 full days of play just to unlock tiers 5 and 6. Now we have to make 4x the amount of stuff with about 10x the work to get to Tiers 7 and 8. We've barely made a dent in it, its been 3 days. It used to be easier, but they made it harder to pad the gameplay because it's an EA title.

Which was absolutely unnecessary, this game can be really fun on its own without excessive amounts of grind.

This game is amazing but i feel that with every creative game you need a good bit of PvE for example minecraft is the perfect mix of creativity and PvE, they have bosses that give you items that you need to make other stuff and progress. It this game had a more advance PvE system it would be 10x more enjoyable. I say just make a few bosses that will drop resources you may need to progress to the next tier and maybe add a more advance weapon system.

Satisfactory is a little overwhelming at first, when you have to slowly create materials yourself, but once you unlock and understand the automation, the game starts to get really fun, allowing the player to not have to focus on producing basic materials, and instead work on exploration, and discovering new resource nodes to build on.

(Edit:) The game has been keeping me up at night until I pass out, I'm not even through tier 6-7 research and as I begin working with fluids I realize that my areas are poorly designed and need to be organized over a large flat plane, and not snaking foundations over cliff faces.

If you've been considering this game, you should absolutely give it a try, and you'll probably get hooked just like I did.

Satisfactory is an amazing game. Not just in the factory building aspect, but also in many other ways.

Obviously, this game is about making a factory. And that it does excellently - goals are clear, it's easy to pick up and keeps you engaged, it's extremely satisfying and it makes your brain work. I know there have been many times where I've built a brand new production line and just stared at it for 10 or 15 mins watching the materials move through the conveyors I just built. It's so satisfying. There's always something new to do or discover, and each tier brings exciting new machines and materials to play with. The progression is excellent too, with the game guiding you to where you need to go but also giving you the freedom to build the biggest factory you want at any point. There are so many dimensions and so many things you can produce in so many different ways - it gives you a framework and then you're free to do whatever.

The graphics are really nice and everything is super detailed. The animations in this game are AWESOME - even early on you start to get multiple favourite animations that you just watch over and over again.

Even though it's a building game, it's also one of exploration. And surprisingly, that it does really well too. The combat, once you get a past the xeno zapper (which happens pretty quickly) is fun, engaging, and satisfying. The alien enemies are well done - I also loved Subnautica, and some of them got me almost as scared as being chased by a reaper leviathan. The enemy design is also really unique - I absolutely didn't expect these going into the game. Apparently there's a story coming by 1.0, too, and it's already written - I'd love that, there's so much potential for a great narrative for this game.

The exploration is great, with the environments being far away but not too far, and each is very unique and very beautiful. All the biomes are different to each other and exploring through them for the first time is really fun and interesting.

Overall, almost every aspect of this game is great and I can barely think of flaws. There's a few bugs here and there, quality of life things, etc, but the graphics are great, the gameplay loop is great, the factory building aspect is well thought out and very fun, and the world in which the game is set is beautiful and interesting.

All this praise, and this game is still early access. Coffee Stain has done an amazing job so far, and I'm sure they'll continue to deliver with Satisfactory.",Recommended,2181,69.1 hrs on record,Posted: July 10

though if done right progress isnt much of an issue if done wrong at first it gets slower and your progress staggers during the beginning of the game if you haven't played the game before it will be slow but as you learn more about automating each resource and as i call it exploiting mother nature for valuable resources you need to make items to progress in the game so if you want a open world game that shows no limits and gives that satisfactory is the game for you give it a chance it wont fail to please if you like games like this",Recommended,452,78.0 hrs on record,Posted: July 9

Single player review.
This game is an absolute blessing to play.
It's lightweight and smooth. I have never dipped below 130fps in 15 hours of gameplay. (1080ti)
The quality of the game is overwhelming, my hat goes off to the developers.

The first 30 mins of the game is a bit hard to get into. I feel like there's improvement to be made there.
Personally I think holding the hand of the player for that duration would be helpful. It would help not feeling like you've never done this before.

I can't wait to see what this game will become. If the devs keeps working hard and keeps this high quality standard, it will definitely be one of the best factory games out there, once it comes out of early access.",Recommended,602,38.6 hrs on record,Posted: July 9

I don't do many reviews, but boy is this game is just excellent! I had been in kind of a gaming funk - nothing really kept my interest for very long. This game really changed all that. The balance of grind to exploration to combat is great and I'm happy there aren't typical ""survival"" mechanics that tend to just be annoying later stage in these types of games.

I was skeptical that this would just be a ""real-life lite"" simulator, but setting up factories and supply chains is surprisingly fun and intuitive right out the gate and incredibly rewarding to master.

I could go on for a while, but suffice it to say: If you're at all into build-it games, this is a must have!",Recommended,571,73.2 hrs on record,Posted: July 9

I can't get no SATISFACTION!

Jokes aside, I used to imagine having a game like this. Open world first person with an emphasis on crafting, and building automated systems, without any pesky survival component (after my many years of runescape) For one, out of all the AAA games I've played it probably looks better on low settings. I don't have the best PC Ever and it looks incredible even with the graphics turned way, way down. The best way to describe it would be a first person Factorio. But in terms of performance I've experienced some minor stutter, which I hope goes away after early access, that said it's not enough to stop me from playing, as this game is excellent. RIP Sleep because I know what I'm playing tonight..

I've never really got into open world games like Skyrim, Fallout, etc but this is the first one I can see myself playing hundreds of hours. I look forward to the development of this game, and may even build a better pc later just to be able to play it at higher settings.",Recommended,841,12.7 hrs on record,Posted: July 8

I will attempt to be clear in brief: It is not worth it's price. Plain and simple. It is a fun game, it is a game that had me play it for 8 straight hours, but I got it on sale and imagined it to be a cleaner looking Factorio. But it isn't, at least not yet. If I may recommend such a game, it's Dyson Sphere Program.

Issues and Solutions
It severely lacks the (what I find to be a very simple yet effective system) basic research system. Using basic mats to create basic research tokens and scaling that. Instead it desires the player to create more and more nonsense from basic resources. I generally dislike it but that may be a person gripe. What however I believe are the two most disruptive parts of this game are as follows: 1. The exploration and 2. The M.A.M. research aside from the Space Elevator research. The exploration is great, for the first time. But the world is not procedural, it is a created map, good for introducing players and very poor for keeping players engaged when they must inhabit the same map constantly. The MAM research, and specifically the alternative research paths are absolutely awful. They don't inspire me to create new factories, they push me to tear down my construction of which I already spent so long optimizing to do it all over again, that is not the game play loop I enjoy. If they were given immediately I wouldn't have issue, they'd allow the player to experiment to find which recipe actually created the best result, instead of handing me a new recipe which is simply a direct upgrade to my current system but is incompatible with it. But nonetheless; I have what I believe to be a very perfect analogy for this game. This is No Man's Sky with automation, and without ships. Now hear me out Devs, what if...what if you put those together, and make a small solar system that can use the existing maps and allows players to still chose starting locations but has very different experiences for the different locations allowing varied play styles on each planet and in the 'end game' you then travel to the different planets and start colonies to feed your mecha world?

I hit the 40 years of age mark, and I've thought a lot about how games used to be more immersive and enjoyable in my younger years.

It's not unusual for me to try a highly praised game and get bored after an hour or two.

Bought this, tried it out. The first night I stayed up to 6am and went to bed only so my girlfriend wouldn't realize how long I had stayed up. I dreamt of factories.

Then the next day I pretty much ignored her and continued to optimize and build factories.

Then I stayed up and continued playing until 6am again.

At some point I'll install the game again and lie to her about working long hours, but until then all I have to say is that it got more out of me in a week than almost any other game has in years.

For the cost to entertainment factor it's already passed it, and it's early access. Crazy.",Recommended,689,43.2 hrs on record,Posted: July 7

This game is now one of my favorites. At the time of this review i only played 12 hours and even with only that much game play i can safely say that this game is loaded with content. If you are a survival minecraft player then this is the perfect game for you. The graphics are movie quality and the overall concept of the game is great. Being a beta game right now there are still some bugs but they are not the worst bugs. One of them is when you crouch while mid air then un-crouch underneath something while still air-born it glitches you into the tree and you get stuck, But and easy fix is just to crouch again then you become unstuck.",Recommended,535,87.2 hrs on record,Posted: July 7

There's no real pressure when it comes to the survival aspect, you won't starve, you can stand still for 3 hours and not die, but don't let this fool you. You will feel the drive to strive ahead and build ever more complex systems to harvest the resources of the planet you're on and when any piece of that puzzle falls into place, the feeling can only really be described as Satisfactory.

ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS GAME! It's sad that it's so under rated. I've got 87 hrs played as of writing this review, and that's just on Steam, not to mention my ungodly amount of time in the first platform it was released on. The amount of time you can spend just gathering resources at first, then tear it down and get more organized, get faster, get upgrades, and so much more!

Not to mention all the exploring you get to do in a very well made world with fona and flora. It's so easy to sink in this game and get lost and just enjoy every aspect of it.

For those that rate this game as NOT good, I tend to see you only have less than 10 hours played. You really need to get much further and more time into it to really give this a fair review, otherwise, I personally don't consider reviews with less than 10 hours played to be honest. There's too many reviews that also bicker and whine about the gameplay which is super minor compared to what does work and is usable.

I personally give this game a 9.6 of 10 due to those minor glitches. However, this game has a long way to go yet and I can't wait to see what comes out next with it.",Recommended,935,86.6 hrs on record,Posted: July 7

I am so ridiculously hooked on this game. It is the dopamine fix that my ADHD-addled brain has craved for years but until now, never could sate.

They didn't have to go so hard on making the graphics this beautiful, but they did. They didn't have to make the sound design so completely perfect, but treat your ears to the sound of belts setting. They didn't have to encourage rebuilding and rethinking your factory layouts by refunding all materials in deconstruction, but clearly, the devs want us to enjoy every part of the game without punishing us for learning or wanting to improve efficiency and aesthetic.

That moment when you wonder why your steel production is so low and then realize your primary foundry has no power because you went to wall mounts from power poles and forgot to connect said foundry.

Problems like this are why I love the game. Figuring out how to get the most efficiency out of your setup, get max production running, so on and so forth. I love a game that forces me to think instead of mindless blasting. Although don't get me wrong, sometimes we all need to do a little mindless blasting to blow off some steam. This game is that, but it's relaxing, fun and well worth your $30.

Don't worry if you're first base (such as what I'm working on now) has a belt system that looks like spaghetti, you can always rebuild and improve.

It's pretty staggering looking back at your humongous, continent-spanning factory, and thinking about how when you started you were just stabbing at some iron ore with a knife.

It's the sort of game where you've always got 5 tasks you want to complete, and every completed task makes you realize there are 2 more things you need to do. You can stop any time you want, but natural stopping points are rare, and thus this game can eat up the hours like few can. If you're the sort to spend all night playing Rimworld, this game will consume you.

Beware that in addition to the GPU, this game is very intensive on your CPU, especially as your factory grows. I had to abandon the game for a while because my old computer was CPU-bottlenecked.",Recommended,627,200.9 hrs on record,Posted: July 7

Great, really great impression by early access game. The maps are large and populated. Easily unerstandable gameplay, decent UI nad UX (for early access). Open world with seamlessly integrated story and discover surpizes. By the time of review the game is in state when its gameplay quite good balanced between calm and adventurous. Grinding-like gameplay is a part of fun in these games.

Good quality of world design, although it lacks some randomality when i restart the sesstion. Thus Satisfactory could benefit from implementation of balanced semi-random resource allocation and repopulating of the world at start. Looking for resources and optimal placement each time would add more replayability. Additionaly Satisfactory would benefit from dinamically changing gameplay (which might be an switchable option for those who like more challenging gameplay) and ecosystem simulation (selflearning AI adaptig the difficulty to the style of playing, which might be an switchable option also; something Rimworld-like maybe).

The game runs in 64bit address space without a lags at low settings (looking great nevertheless) on my 16GB RAM laptop, with integrated GPU of i7 CPU.

Definitely recommend.

It's...alright I guess? The core loop just isn't that fun. Placing buildings is really fiddly and frustrating. Most of your time is spent running back and forth between your mines to the various production areas. The first person perspective gets in the way far more than it's a fun feature. Perhaps these things will be fixed before the full release, but as it stands, I can't recommend this game to anyone.",Not Recommended,356,9.7 hrs on record,Posted: July 7

The game has such a great replay value, since the building possibilities are endless in themselves and then there are more maps to choose from. From the eyes of a game designer in his early days, I can see flaws that not everyone would notice (especially in the generation of the world) but that doesn't bother me at all and actually makes it likeable.

This is a very Satisfying game, pun intended. Lots 'o' content to unlock, and a decent yet not frustrating challenge to be found in unlocking it. I'd highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys engineering style problems and building infrastructure. I personally really enjoy the process of setting everything up and later on fine-tuning my setup to get a greater efficiency. Also, the fact that there will be more content in the future is really exciting, since I've only just unlocked nearly all of the available content in my first playthrough. Pretty sure the replay value is high on this one :)
Although there are plenty of glitches still, most of them aren't annoying. In fact, most of the glitchy things I've seen are either harmless visual glitches or ones that actually increase your freedom to build in different ways within the game! Even better, the developers acknowledge this and agree to keep those glitches which increase the enjoyability of the game.
All things said, I'd rate this game 10/10 and I look forward to the new content when it comes, as well as any lore that may be added to flesh out the game's more ominous bits and pieces (currently WIP)",Recommended,991,136.5 hrs on record,Posted: July 7

This game is absolutely amazing! I honestly don't know where to even begin! The opening sequence had me so excited - the planet fall, the music, and the doors opening to the epic landscape filled with potential, was just beautiful. The concept of the game and the futuristic feel is so well accomplished. The UI is masterly crafted and so intuitive. The game just looks downright gorgeous. I cannot believe the game is in this state and it's only early access! Satisfactory really cares about user experience; by design it's made to quickly build, erase, and rebuild your bases/factories for consistent improvement and 'efficiency'.

I recently described this game as an endeavor which some might find boring, while others find it completely awesome.
I'm very much in the latter camp.
I love building and production oriented games, so for me, this game has proven to be fantastic.
I can understand how others may not enjoy it's crafting and production focused sandbox, with limited exploration and alien killing, but for those of us who enjoy setting up networks of distribution and construction, those of us with some level of OCD where we really need to have those conveyors and pipelines lined up correctly, those of us who must continue to achieve the next level of technology to progress into a whole new set of challenges, this game is quite excellent.
I even enjoyed the time I spent taking down the nuclear production network since it was creating so very much waste and danger in parts of my map. Who knew that the process of getting rid of something I built would be fun, too?

It's a great game thats optimisation is amazing for its graphics, the gameplay is also great until around half-way through, which is where i have my issues. Resources are plentiful at the start, but as you require lots more it becomes an annoyance to have to travel very far away for resources, not to mention getting power there and running items back on conveyors. Also, in a lot of places you need multiple resources, such as requiring , meaning you need to travel such a long way and get the two materials together from very far apart.

Another great experience from Coffee Stain.

Only grab this game if you have the time, curiosity, and patience to really invest in this genera! This game is a steal at the sale price and a huge sleeper for 2021.

-The world is massive, beautiful, dangerous, and beckons you to explore it.
-The mechanics are beautifully polished and feed into each other in a very well thought out progression.
-Progression feels rewarding and scales well with each advancement.
-The game runs great and though it is an ""early access"" title at the time of this review, I have yet to experience any crashes or major bugs.
-There is subtle humor tucked into all the interactions you have with the company you work for.

A lot of this game reminds me of the joys of playing Minecraft around the time it was first acquired by Microsoft. Back then, we played it on Xbox 360 and before creative mode was introduced. Like Minecraft, this game is one where you kind of have to create your own fun, in some ways.

There's isn't much of a story - you're mostly just a worker who's been tasked with mining resources and sending products out to your space homies. You have loose objectives - ""build this stuff, and then you'll be able to build this other stuff that will unlock"". Everything builds off of each other, so there's a natural progression of unlocking new components as you advance through the game to build new materials that lets you build other things.

The fun you have in this game is what you make of it, just like in Minecraft. It's a sandbox game with loose objectives and you're constantly building bigger and more efficient assembly lines to produce goods better and faster. You'll probably find that you spend an hour or so building an assembly line and then ten hours later you tear it all down and rebuild it even more efficiently than you did before, and it's never frustrating! You don't think ""meh, but that's an hour of my life I won't get back!"" You just do it and enjoy the puzzle-solving aspects of it all. And that's really what this game is... it's an open-ended puzzle game where you're finding creative solutions to get to the next objective, and the objective is what you choose it to be.

This is a really fun game. It's challenging. It's thought-provoking. It's got a ton of number-crunching behind the scenes that you can completely ignore or dive head-first into to build a better assembly. I do wish that the game had procedural generation, but that's only a minor inconvenience, and I only suggest it because there are a ton of resources for ""go here and build your base here at this spot for the best resources"" and it takes some of the fun and excitement out of the game. All in all though, if you enjoy games that feature resource management, exploration, solving creative processes, base building, light combat, and freedom to play when and how you want to, then give Satisfactory a shot!",Recommended,2035,74.6 hrs on record,Posted: July 6

Honestly, one of the most addicting games that I've ever had the privilege of playing. There are quite a few pros and cons I'd like to lay out about this game. Firstly though, I'd like to note that this game is well worth the asking price, even unfinished.

Pros:
The hand crafted world is really beautiful and the ambiance draws you in completely. The animals in the world make it feel alive, and even though they are annoying sometimes, they add a new level of immersion to the game.
The game itself is beautiful, and the options to make a more naturalistic type factory or an enclosed warehouse are both there, making two, and possibly more play styles to enjoy.
On top of that, the vehicles and the fun factor in this game are really high... If you're sick of making stuff, just make a race course or skate park to play in with your friends.

Cons:
There are a lot of cons, and that's to be expected, in no way did they make me want to return the game, however.
Firstly, there is no way to equip multiple items to the body, it would make sense for some items to work together, i.e. the gas mask and the blade runner.... As these don't conflict with each other whatsoever. It would also add a whole new level of mobility as you got to higher levels. Having to switch out the jetpack and the bladerunner sometimes seems unnecessary.
There is no real functional way of snapping and locking the place of buildings in order to make them properly aligned. If you are a bit pickier about this, it might drive you crazy. You'll constantly find yourself placing buildings in the wrong spot and having to redo their placement.
I expect in a future update they will add more cosmetic furniture so you can make your own little home away from factory, so to speak, or the ability to lounge on the couch while you watch your glorious production lines from the window above.
Animal husbandry still seems like it's in its infancy, but I look forward to future updates to see what happens to that. :)

As I said, this game is amazing and the price tag justifies the content, heck, it's worth more money than I think its going for. It's still early access though, so there's a few rough patches to work out. Hope you enjoy this game as much as I do.",Recommended,1851,261.2 hrs on record,Posted: July 6

Spent 9 hours straight playing, but was smiling the whole time. Be careful if you get addicted easily, particularly if you have OCD. On the other hand, this game has features to optimize your factory to the point that this game may be GREAT for someone with OCD. I will say it's a bit heavy on processing, I get about 10fps, which some would consider unplayable, but I played minecraft on 1.13.0 at 3fps so I just have ridiculously high tolerances for low fps gameplay. Honestly the games feel, especially with its soundtrack, are very reminiscent of minecraft. Also, a small tip: before you get ladders, watchtowers are a great way to gain height quickly.",Recommended,560,89.3 hrs on record,Posted: July 6

The worlds are beautiful and seem to never stop surprising your with more content, including petting baby alien dogs. This will keep you busy for hours on end.

You can see how I addict to this game via viewing my playing hours.
It's definitely you do enjoy building your own base from morning to evening !!!

Here are some suggestions for improving the game making it more playable even you have reached maximum milestone.
1. Create planting system, planting Mycelia, Beryl Nut, Paleberry, Bacon Agaric, etc.
2. Provide more upgrades, like Water Extractor Level2, extending the length of covey belt/ wire.
3. It's hard to make high tech products, like Nuclear Pasta, Copper Powder..... WITHOUT new rewards.
At middle level of milestone, u can get many encouragement to reach higher milestone. This is essential for players to get rewards. Maybe in faster transportation (Blade Runners Level2 / airplane ) / logistic , higher capacity in storage.
4. Auto robot for building foundations.
5. Making Crash Sites more important. Lets say you can only build special buildings (radar/ functional lookout tower) on it
6. Special transportation under water. New resources under water.",Recommended,880,290.8 hrs on record,Posted: July 5

I really want to like this game but I'm slightly disappointed. The soul purpose of me purchasing this game was to play it cooperatively. Granted, I do understand the game is still in early access and it does in fact disclose that multiplayer can be significantly more buggy, yet I am unable to play with anybody. Ever since I booted the game up and tried to play with a friend, I am unable to invite anybody to the game. I suspect it has something to do with the game telling me that the ""Host NAT"" is labeled ""TBD"". I have looked high and low to try to find a solution to my dilemma and to no avail I am still left in the dark on this.

It may not even be the games fault, it could very well be something that I am doing wrong and if anybody is willing to enlighten me on said topic it would be much appreciated.",Not Recommended,672,1.0 hrs on record,Posted: July 5

I will be short and concise because I have neither time nor desire to write and even you who read I do not think you want to waste too much of your time.

The game is beautiful and can be played for many hours but like everything it has its pros and cons.
This review, although negative, doesn't mean ""don't buy the game"", no! But it's something to entice developers to do more!






It is still an early access game, therefore not free from bugs and lack of fundamental functions, but it is not a problem. Nothing that could spoil the gameplay too much
For example, trains, like many structures, do not have collisions. So you can go through them and build through them.
Also, there is not yet a system to release fluid such as water, you need to flow the pipes or the buffers manually. This can easy ""fix"" by edit the water pump and add an option to drain water instead of extract.





Is 30 € well spent? Yes.
Would I play it for many hours? If you're into that genre, you'll make it a lot of hours.
The game is updated in steps of months, perhaps a bit slow and the developers have the habit of taking days off for every single holiday, extending the development a lot, but in the end it is updated and I think it will be for a long time.",Not Recommended,1032,143.4 hrs on record,Posted: July 5

Superb game for Builders. It beats most other games out there (if not all, but then there is the matter of tastes). The graphics are beautiful and the music quite relaxing.

So I've been playing Satisfactory for a week or so with my kids, sinking a decent amount of time into learning the game and how it works. Consider this an initial review.

The exploration side is really impressive for an early access game. The world is handcrafted and quite beautiful in places, and great fun to explore. The vehicles are fun to drive around in so far (I've only unlocked up to the truck so far - more on why later). The sound fits the ambience really well, and the graphics are smooth and clean. There are a few glitches to be found, like getting stuck in trees when you try to climb them, and the draw distance creates some really jarring pop-ins at times. I'm hopeful these will get fixed with time.

The factory/building side definitely scratches my optimisation itch, and while I'll try not to compare it to Factorio it does fill the '3D Factorio' void that I never knew I was missing. Placing production lines and tinkering with over/underclocking machines so that everything is perfectly balanced feels great and would make Thanos proud. Getting your first small factory perfectly set up and running optimally is a great feeling!

So would I recommend it? Well, no, not at this stage.

The first tiers of research can be completed more or less with just your starting HUB and a local factory. As you go up the research tiers each new item requires more production of the previous tier items, in a natural progression. Steel is where I first started to really scale up production and subsequently factory sizes, and ran into the brick wall that is factory building in Satisfactory. Everything must be placed individually. Everything. Every time.

If you're like me and you've designed a modular factory from the start, so you can just scale it easily to increase production? Nope. Every foundation, every machine, every belt and every splitter/merger/power line must be placed, one at a time, by hand. Every machine must have its recipe set individually. I'm looking at hundreds of machines, and thousands of items in total, all to be placed by hand - and I'm only in the mid-game! And heaven forfend you unlock an alternate, more efficient recipe, because then you need to tear down and redesign the factory all over again.

There are no blueprint or copy/paste planners in the game, and the Devs have said repeatedly that they won't be implementing them either, as they want every item to be hand-placed. That's fine, it is their game after all, but I definitely don't agree. There are mods available as workarounds, but I find them unreliable to use (more practice may change that).

To clarify the above, I'm not looking for a creative mode to fix this problem, though that would be nice to have regardless. What I would like is to be able to hand place a factory module, laid out perfectly, and then select it (including all of the power lines, belts, foundations as well) and build it again if I have the resources in my inventory. Exactly the same build process as now, only I'm building more than one item at a time. That's all.

So to sum up - I enjoy playing the early game, and exploring the world with my kids. But if you enjoy building large-scale factories that are efficient, and you don't have days to spend each time you need to change something, I would not recommend the game at this point.",Not Recommended,2772,153.7 hrs on record,Posted: July 5

I MUST BE EFFICIENT
Satisfactory is a brilliant Early Access game by Coffee Stain Studios. The objective is to build a factory on an alien planet and make it as efficient as possible. The game ropes you in with a fairly straight forward tutorial and keeps things easy at the start, getting progressively more micro-managing and new as you continue to reach milestones and objectives. I did think to myself ""Why would I want to have a game where I just make a factory and create resources?"", but before I knew it, I was playing the game consistently for a while because it had me hooked. You manage power, train lines, drones, conveyor belts, it never seems to end. It has a calm feel to it, enemies don't come and ruin your factory, they just lurk about in the exploration areas and you can create weapons to defend yourself against them when you are adventuring across the huge map that is available to you. There's many different ways to build, its entirely up to you as long as you have the resources. The community behind the game is great and seeing other peoples builds gives you inspiration and it pushes creativity out of everyone. I rate Coffee Stain Studios very well for their developer updates and community interaction and can confidently say that this game is worth buying at full price even with the Early Access title attached to it. On top of all this, the game looks graphically pleasing and finds the gap where it isn't too demanding but looks good. I've played a few times with friends too and it helps to get the factories off the floor when you start a new world. The game is a gem and should be in all Steam libraries.

With my current factory, I'm near an end game point, and it's definitely dragging due to the fact I have less to focus on. The new update does help end game factories and builders by giving that new content itch, but it could do with some more to it when you're at that point. Apart from that, the game is a no brainer.",Recommended,1622,167.0 hrs on record,Posted: July 4

Played the game for like 6 hours and I feel like it is an insult to the devs themselves to not play it for 100 hours. Unlike other base builder games, this game is one of if not the most satisfying base builder I have ever played. The game never encourages you to grind but rather encourages you to find ways to make that grind quicker and while doing so, you create this absolute marvel of a factory and the feeling of being proud of your work is there. Just like other base builder or ""survival"" games, this game has no end goal. One of the things that impress me so much is the fact that this is still in early access bu there are so much mechanics and new things added that I feel so happy.
To play this game properly, you should be a pretty intelligent to play it sufficiently but this game is so forgiving. They do not show you everything they got from the get go but instead throws their mechanics one at a time. This makes the game 100x more beginner friendly and the only time new mechanics will be added is if you want it to.
I will continue playing this game for 10 or 200 more hours cuz I don't see myself stopping anytime soon. It truly is a satisfactory",Recommended,961,106.6 hrs on record,Posted: July 4

In much the same way that you download MFS and upon seeing in the description that it is a ""game"" you think, ""heeeey, maybe there is a goal or a purpose"" and then after you fly around for a few minutes you have the slowly dawning realization that, ""♥♥♥♥, this is it; holy god, this is so utterly anti-climatic"" and then you feel the emptiness that is just. Doing. Nothing. You will find Satisfactory decidedly barren. In addition the possibilities for your ""factory"" like say, magically almost goofy curving conveyor belts, are so at odds with what purports to be that it is hard to stay invested even up to and concurrent with a simulator.

Definitely not recommended in its current form. I will revisit in two or three years to see if there is any improvement.",Not Recommended,735,1.9 hrs on record,Posted: July 4

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
This review is from the perspective of someone who IS NOT big into these types of games. I tried it based on the O-positive reviews, but just didn't find the fun. Unlike Subnautica, there was little to no incentive to build a base. Not much of a story-line to speak of; just you, on this planet, building a factory. I've learned I need objectives and reasons to do something rather than just because it's there, and this game, for me, didn't provide that.",Not Recommended,408,1.2 hrs on record,Posted: July 4

Played for an hour or 2 so far and this is a great game. Theres not too much of a learning curve and everything is kept fairly simple while still keeping you wanting more. There are very few bugs considering the fact it's still in development. The only bug i've come across is the conveyer belts wanting to place into the ground, blocking whatever is on the conveyerbelt.

You don't need to spend forever gathering material and the crafting menu makes it very easy to make what you need. The building part of the game is just as simple and doesn't try to be overly complicated. I do wish that I had started in a more open area as the game suggested because my system is very congested.

I like the odd aliens that wander about, especially the giant potato with legs. Overall, I would highly suggest this game for the hardcore or passive gamer as it has a lot to offer and doesn't require a PhD to remember things if you drop off for a week or 4.",Recommended,787,2.8 hrs on record,Posted: July 3

It's only getting better and going further than Factorio ever could. If you liked factorio at all, this game has to be in your library.

Aside from the factorio comparisons, this game totally stands on its own and has good humor as well. Doesn't take itself too seriously. Love it.",Recommended,447,7.9 hrs on record,Posted: July 3

FriendlyKomodo,https://steamcommunity.com/id/FriendlyKomodo/,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
So, so, so, Satisfactory. Where do I begin? And where do I end? Much like a new players first attempt at a factory which lead to spaghetti, let's start at the beginning. Yknow. As any place should, I suppose!

I first learned of Satisfactory when I'd been followin' coffee stain on twitter. Big fan of sanctum and all that. Got sad it was an EGS thing, waited for it to hit steam and so it did. Bought it when I found out. So, how do I feel about it?

All in all, I think it's quite good. The music feels chill, I absolutely adore the designs in this game. They've crafted such a pretty world that is rather quite large, too. And packed it full of things to find or just nice places ot look at. And the designs of the buildings and vehicles and just.. stuff like that? It's all boxy, orange,I love it. It's great.

The actual main part, the building + factory stuff, is.. about what you'd expect I suppose! You get introduced to the basics, figure out how some things work, and things get more complicated. You find, handcraft, automate, unlock, and kinda repeat, and so it goes. Though, I think Satisfactory is a bit more easy to.. grasp? So long as you're willing to do some maths. Yknow, stuff like ""Oh hey, this uses 15. I make 30 currently. I have 120 of this, so 120 divided by 30"" and so on.

You can make some spaghetti with your conveyors or power lines but.. the game don't mind too much. Things like conveyors and pipes can clip through eachother most of the time and.. Yknow hwat? I'm okay with that. There are other factory games (which I shall not mention for many reasons) which don't let me do that. And sometimes it hurts my brain when I can't. We aren't all experts, and some of us don't wanna watch a 3 hour long video guide on how to set up the most efficient factory and take out the fun of figuring it out. I appreciate that I can break physics every now and then.

Anyway, that's the building part. So how about the rest?
It goes simple enough. You got your irons, your iron products, your copper and copper products early game, iron becomes more complicated when you need 3 things to make 3 other things that require 2 of the before mentioned thing, yknow. Stuff like that.

Then you get your coals and your irons and your steels, and your slowly but surely increasingly complicated products from it.
Other liquids get added, and byproducts from those liquids you need to plan for andadd into your increasingly complicated layouts, all that stuff. Mind, I don't think the early/mid game is that hard to work your brain around? It's when you get oils and long ra nge transport things get.. weird, to me at least.

(addendum: I forgot to add this, but to make a quick edit: Exploration is rewarded with a lot, but keep a keen eye. You find Freighters dotted about the place. Fix them up, get their harddives. Scan them at the M.A.M. and you'll be rewarded with some alt-recipes. Some of these are amazing and game changers. Love; a confused lizard)

Another thing I think benefits this, I get the feeling the people making the map were actually kinda smart. I've found several locations that are just wonderfully perfect for certain things. Find a nice lil place to make steel in the rocky desert. I got something that needs steel pipes and copper, and then I got hit by it
""Oh, ♥♥♥♥! RIGHT, MY STEEL PLACE HAS COPPER NEXT TO IT.""

I feel this game is kinda slow a lot of the time. There's a lot of periods where.. nothing is really going on? You're just kinda waiting for your machines to do the heavy lifting before you unlock the new stuff. Use those down times to explore your surroundings. Figure out where you'll source new materials, pathways to take, find slugs, find delicious carapace or organs, get terrified by the local fauna when you realise there's creepy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ spiders that spit acidic spikes at you
(or, in my case, pictures of floating cat faces that drool green slime because I have arachnophobia mode on. Yes, there is ""I'm scared of spiders"" mode that replaces them with floating cat faces. And the cats meow, instead of make the horrid skittering sound those Stingers make.)

The game gives you some movement options relatively early on if you can find them. Here's some advice, if you want it:

Oh, I forgot to mention. So you can ""Overclock"" things in this game. You unlock it early on, and they very much want you to use it. It lets you simplify, or complicate, your designs. You can find these slugs all over the place, I call them ""Friends"", and you can use them to make power shards. Plug power shards into something, and it starts working faster. Something like a screw constructor uses 10 iron rods, and a single iron rod constructor makes 15. Soo.. rather than building 2 of those and building 3 of the others, you could just make 1, overlock the other to 150% and make things less of a headache.
EDIT: I learnt that Overclocking drastically increases power usage of a building. So much so that a single refinery will use about 150 MW at 250% overclock. So careful with that! underclocking has the opposite effect. In terms of energy use, underclocking buildings uses a lot less power but requires you to use more space when building.

I think the only thing I /don't/ like about this game is the early game power. It's all handcrafted or hand found. I don't really enjoy running around, picking up leaves and wood, turning it into biomass, into solid biofuel, dumping it into biofuel burners and then getting to work and praying I work fast enough to ""out-run"" the situation where i run out of fuel and I have to spend another age cutting down trees and foliage to power the generators.

The moment you unlock coal and coal burners, this problem goes away. So my advice? Get Coal Power ASAP.

I love the movement options in this game. Anywhere from ""ride on my power line"" to ""Jump pads, baby!"" to ""I'm going to make this tube so long I will afk for 5 minutes as I get flung towards my oil by a transparent tube.""
Unfortunately, I can't tell you what I think of mid/late game, because I never made it that far. I always end up feeling terrible that I can't build right, or i just don't have the energy to figure it out. But just because I get sad about it, doesn't mean you shouldn't check Satisfactory out if it catches your fancy.

Just remember, if you're struggling to figure it out.. just take a step back. Take a few breaths, and just go ""Alright, let me break this down in my head.""

And remember, if you need space, platforms are your friend. No room? Build up. FICSIT encourages verticality to streamline short range transportation. But they also defy physics, and if you want you could just make a floating sky factory on platforms.


... Okay, one more thing. The space elevator is one of the coolest ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ things ever. I never get tired of seeing that animation. Or watching my constructors work.. or listening to the sound of machinery chug and hum. It's great.",Recommended,5711,221.7 hrs on record,Posted: July 3

I'm a 1000 hours in, and still playing.

If you like base building, balancing production lines, and minor scrapes of combat to mix things up, then this is a good game to lose track of time playing.

Beautiful hand placed world, plenty of exploration the first few go arounds and I'm still discovering things I haven't seen before here and there.

Combat is limited, not a focal point to the game at all, but still something to get the heart racing at times.

Very chill, there's never a running clock, get done what you do when you do. Milestones along the way reward you for progress with new recipes/gear/buildings etc.

Multiplayer is a bit wonky, only real drawback atm. It isn't as plug and play as the rest of the game but it's getting better and some have more luck with it than others.

So if you like the way that sounds, snag the game.",Recommended,715,"1,074.9 hrs on record",Posted: July 3

Update after 126 h:

One of the best games I've played in many years, it's the only game which returns the game experience of the ancient Transport Tycoon (TTD) game from the 90s. The setting up of conveyor belts and controlling input-output is pretty much like the railway construction in that old classic but in 3D, plus you unlock trains in midgame. Because of this the game has as much replay value as it too because you can always find new ways to accomplish what you want.

TTD didn't have any objectives and still was fun and so is Satisfactory, although there is no money in Satisfactory but TTD didn't have a tier progression system.

Game is good as it is, anything extra is a bonus in terms of new updates. The fun factor increases the more you progress in the game compared to many games that stagnate midgame, if you find the beginning to be fun then expect it to be uberfun later on. If you find the very beginning to be dull with manual harvest for fueling biomass generators please be patient and unlock coal power as soon as possible as then electricity generation becomes automated then and you almost don't have to do much manual labor anymore other than building structures and crafting some handheld equipment.

There is at least one annoying bug but it isn't game breaking except that I lost an Explorer vehicle that went underground more than once (which I recovered via some 3rd party tool). Some building blocks have issues to snap in place properly such as the walkway ramps. The AI drivers which follow recorded routes can be a bit crazy, don't stand in their way because they don't care if you or your vehicle are there and they tend to get stuck if you don't plan their routes very carefully (which may lead to them going out of fuel somewhere so you need to go on a rescue mission).

Original review:

The game is interesting for players who would like a focus on the engineering part of construction games, because you build your own industry on an alien planet and are responsible for resource gathering (via automatic miners very early), electricity production and managing various kinds of machines like constructors and assemblers to manufacture components which can be used to place new structures or finish progression tiers.

You start off with quite a bit of micromanagement which can become automated eventually as you progress, and it can be annoying to fill machines like biofuel manually, but as you progress machines can handle it and it's not too much of a nuisance. Micromanagement will always involve setting up and changing production queues and making sure you have enough juice so a fuse won't blow.

The game lacks a real purpose for your industry, like an economy, which other reviews have also highlighted and is something the developer could work on, however I understand it's an alpha game so I'm not loudly criticizing them. But the tier system of progression keeps you occupied for hours and it's unfair to whine too much about it.

The challenge of the game is to make your industry more efficient like prevent machines from causing delays to other machines, maximize the output, and so you don't have to do things by hand, for example move things manually between machines, which can be a challenge. A lot of the stuff can be automated if you set it up properly.",Recommended,2768,251.4 hrs on record,Posted: July 3

It's great if you like pretending to be an engineer, mechanic, explorer, etc. I bought the game for $23.99 and I believe it's worth it. I have been having a blast the first 10+ hours, and can't wait to play some more tomorrow. Very polished for early access, I became glued to the floor once in the 10+ hours I played and just loaded a recent auto-save to undo it. The only other down side I hope they improve upon is that the game only has one hand made map, which limits replay-ability. The game is unfinished but I am still putting in many hours. I am running out of new things to do, so hopefully they add some more content soon. As I have been playing, I have noticed many clipping issues with getting stuck on certain aspects of the terrain, and I have to load an auto-save most times to fix it, I lose a little bit of time when it happens, but it doesn't happen all the time, but it is annoying when it does happen. The auto-save is similar to Valheim, in it causes you to lag briefly when flying with the jetpack, and has caused me to get injured a few times. I have found items that do not have a use yet, but I am hanging onto them for now. There are also items I find (sprites I guess) that are hovering/floating in the air, which ruins some of the immersion. That's all I can say for now. I do not particularly like using the scroll wheel to cycle through my gear in my belt, it takes too long and does not seem to follow a predictable order and when you need a certain weapon or other item quickly, it is not reliable at all, there should be a hot bar or quickbar for you weapons like you have for building parts etc.",Recommended,1330,196.7 hrs on record,Posted: July 3

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
I played this game but I had to get a refund. The main reasons were: (1) I need a zoomable camera where I can look down upon buildings, etc. - I never did like first-person on any of my games; (2) I prefer the snap-to-grid style rather than free placement, only for stylistic reasons and my OCD; (3) I know it is in 'early access' phase right now, so many upgrades are coming, but since I am not sure what that will look like, I decided to play it safe and come back to this title at another date (for another sale).

It seems to be a really good game, primarily graphically for its genre. For this game, I think that XBOX Controller support would be awesome. I will keep an eye out for the 'Creative Mode' they are talking about. Also, I am interested in this game due to the great communication of the developer - that's what made me take the plunge in the first place. I am sure I will be back to buy Satisfactory.",Recommended,776,2.5 hrs on record,Posted: July 2

A very good first-person version of automation/supply chain games like Factorio, Dyson Sphere Program, etc. The world feels fleshed out with lots of different creatures and diverse environments to explore. The FICSIT aesthetic and design is very sleek, what you would expect from a futuristic company. I also love the sound design in the game! There are a number of sounds, like pinging the location of nearby resources, that are extremely satisfying to hear.

Remember, the game is still in Early Access and you will find bugs or limits to the game's content. There are a handful of resources with the WIP (Work in Progress) label and the multiplayer experience leaves something to be desired.

Primero que nada el juego esta bien optimizado. Las animaciones de las maquinas y herramientas son muy buenas y desde el momento en que inicie con mis primeras herramientas me atrapo en el apartado grafico.
La curva de nivel es muy buena: Comienzas con un crafteo a mano muy basico para despues pasar a un crafteo automatizado, que es de lo que va el juego. La complejidad de los materiales que debes de craftear va aumentando poco a poco y el proceso comienza a ser mas largo y aunque esto puede sonar tedioso en realidad es lo divertido del juego.

SE EFICIENTE, es el lema del juego y conforme el juego avanza vas a querer generar lineas de trabajo mucho mas eficientes para cumplir tus objetivos.
Nunca crei que un juego donde haces una fabrica podria ser asi de divertido.
El juego se transforma cuando comienzas a tener herramientas que te permiten recorrer largas distancias, es un mundo muy basto y tendras que recorrer largos tramos para encontrar varios depositos de recursos.

Hay enemigos y peligros; si decides enfrentarlos con amigos es extremadamente divertido.

This game is so fun to play! I bought it last week and have already sunk 30+ hours into it!

Pros:
- Great progression/upgrade system
- Progression feels rewarding
- Machines all have their own purpose and figuring out how to daisy chain the right things together is rewarding

Cons:
- Its early access, and prone to some bugs such as getting stuck
- Story incomplete due to early access
- Can lag out slower PCs when there is a lot of stuff going on at once

Honestly the only thing negative I have to say about this game are things that are excused from it being early access. Once they finish this game and iron out the bugs, it will be phenomenal!!!!!!",Recommended,561,32.5 hrs on record,Posted: July 1

Purchased this game initially through the Epic store while is was still in its beginner stages. Came from a background of some Factorio, Astroneer, and Rimworld game play. I absolutely fell in love with this game on first game play. Beautiful scenery, 3D crafting and logistics, entertaining and humorous dialogue, and the thrill of obtaining more to see what else the game had to offer as you progressed.

I like this game so much that I had to purchase it on the Steam platform as well. By far the most exciting aspect of this game is by far the community and the development team behind it. The hard work, dedication, emotions, and passion they put into the game makes me thrilled to watch an update trailer and learn more about the team on an individual level.

The most polished EA game I have ever seen. Its incredibly slick in everything it does and aside from a few “WIP” objects littered around the landscape already feels like a full finished game.

Its basically a AAA Factorio but not as complex in terms of production chains and is more relaxed. Less combat but more exploration.

This game is pretty great. I found it first when watching Let's Game It Out, but there's much more you can do with this game than what he shows you in his videos. You'll definitely start off with a more sloppy factory, but once you get the hang of the game, you can make a better one somewhere else on the map. Speaking of, the maps for this game are great, they may be dangerous a bit, but they are quite good looking. If you want a factory game, this will be the best one you can find around.

TL;DR it's worth paying for, and even more fun with friends, but playable by oneself.",Recommended,487,18.1 hrs on record,Posted: July 1

Incredibly fun and I've had many amazing moments so far. I've gotten to T6 so my feedback will be from that experience.

Visuals - 9/10
Audio - 9/10
Mechanics - 7/10
Gameplay elements: 5/10

WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD

Feedback on mechanics and gameplay elements:

+ Building with conveyors and lifts is incredibly fun. You can make some really wacky factories and setups.

+ Removing and adding structures is fast and versatile. Well done on that end.

- There's only one ""body"" slot. You can't wear more than one of for example blade runners, jetpack nor the gas mask. Switching between these is incredibly annoying and frequently disrupts the gameplay.

- Machines cannot tilt one bit. Building in slopes is awkward.

- It's not feasible to elevate machines/foundations to a desired height without an anchor point from somewhere else and even with that, they'll either be floating in the air or standing on foundations from the ground.

- It'd be great if you could swap the input/outputs for machines which have both fluids and items, like the refinery. It's more or less a symmetry/design thing and irrelevant for mechanics.

- Alternative recipes often don't make sense. For example, Caterium Ingots can give Copper Wire, they are two different materials and it makes no sense. It's great that core resources can be produced in much higher quantities later on. Maybe there could be dynamic recipes instead.

- Conveyor belts require no power and seemingly run from nothing. Some nodes can be kilometers from your main base and transporting these via conveyor belts is taxing on game performance. Trains is an option but they're incredibly power consuming, especially when you need them around T5-6.

- There's a lack of variety for arsenal. I would love to see something like a bow or crossbow.

- More often than not you'll encounter the same enemies, i.e fire/acid spitting dinosaurs, charging dinosaurs, the airborne stingers and/or spiders and they all exist in every biome.

- There's only 4 types of healing items, deez nuts, bacon things, berries and the medical item.

A perfect game for sitting back. It is similar to Factorio but it isn't top-down and the survival/mob elements are less extreme. The game runs well on a medium rig PC. The overall aesthetic of the game is very pleasing, especially with it being uniform, industrial and chaotic simultaneously. Hopefully Coffee Stain keeps this game going, especially due to its success. I hope before release, they add cards, badges and achievements before official release though. It would be a nice touch. However, in my opinion, if you are looking for a factory/resource management-sim, this is perfect for newbies, whilst providing great change for experienced players.",Recommended,570,79.6 hrs on record,Posted: June 30

Greetings.

I would very much recommend this game for anyone who loves factory-type games and exploration, and doesn't mind some very minor combat. (Also, you should probably make sure your computer can run it.)

When I first got this game, I was playing on a computer with integrated radeon graphics (if you are not a nerd, basically I was playing on a potato). I had about 6 fps on ultra low settings, but I still enjoyed it. More on that later. After a couple months on that, I switched to a computer with a Ryzen 7 4000H Processor and a GTX 1650 ti with 16 gb of ram. With those specs, I am currently able to run a decently sized factory at 60 fps on Ultra Settings. This has made the game much more enjoyable, but I never hated it even when it was running at 6 fps. This is because I love the core gameplay elements this has to offer. My favorite part is going from nothing to hand-crafting to a small unorganized factory to a better and bigger factory to many factories around the world to a whole network of factories working together just to make over 50 turbo-motors per minute.

Here's how it works: You select a place (I would suggest the green hills just because it is very easy to start in). Then, you find your first node (usually of iron). Then, you start hand-picking at that thing until you can create a way to do that automatically. But, iron ore isn't very useful. You need to craft it into something, so now you are sitting at the crafting bench, waiting for your iron to be made into something else when you say, ""I should really automate this."" And after that, once you set up a production chain, you can go explore, and when you come back, you will have bins full of materials. You then just keep going. It never really gets boring. You can either make super efficient factories capable of making a TON of items per minute, or you can make a less efficient factory that works okay, but wastes a lot of time and materials. But it is really up to you, and how you choose to play.

Power is also fun. When you start out, you are having to feed these biomass burners with leaves and sticks in order to keep power, but then, you unlock coal power, fuel power, geothermal power, and then (spoiler) ! And that last one is complicated to say the least, but by that point, you'll be ready for it.

The map is huge. Though it is finite, it never feels like it. Yes, I have seen the edge of the map, but it is nothing to be concerned about. You will never run out of room to build a base.

There is some mild combat to the game, but it's nothing much. If you go exploring and you are un-equiped for the area, then it might be a challenge. But throughout the game, you will be able to upgrade your weapons to make it even easier.

Mods! Unfortunately, there is no built-in support for Mods in Steam, but they are possible, you just need to download Satisfactory Mods Manager via their website online, so once you do that, it's not a very big deal. There are three types of mods in my opinion: one, the game-breaking types that some might like, but I don't. Two: The types that are game-breaking if you abuse them, but can be helpful if you just don't want to take time going to your storage room. Lastly, there is the third type which are useful mods that just make life easier. With the right combination, mods can either make a playthrough more enjoyable, or just mix things up if you are playing again.

I, myself, have not quite finished one playthrough, but I'm close. And when I do, I'll just start over and instead take a different approach in automating every item in the game. I don't think I'll be bored for a while at least.

So, again, I highly recommend this game if you like factory-type games and exploring. Again, the combat is not too bad, and the game is very optimized . But apart from that, just a couple of tips for you if you do decide to buy this:

1) Just build a storage room, guys. It makes it all easier.
2) The second you unlock Hypertubes, USE THEM, and put them all around your base.
3) Overclock as many miners as possible. You can build infinite machines, but there are limited resource nodes.
4) Just because a line's materials isn't moving doesn't mean you can just split that line and take whatever you need; that might be supporting a production chain that is just not currently in use and all backed up.
5) Don't forget about research! It is useful.
6) Build a starting factory that is messy, then, leave your computer running for a couple of hours. Then, come back, and then use those resources that were just generated to build your new, permanent factory.
7) Trains are cool, but too many of them start to lag, so be careful. (I am unsure about drones)
8)

9)

I enjoyed my time with the game, animations are great and the aesthetics are great, there is plenty to do and exploration is generally pretty fun. The enemies can be a little frustrating to fight however.

The only thing I didn't like was around tier 8 the ratios of components became very tedious, with some items taking 4 or 5 assemblers worth of expensive items. Up to that point the game was amazing so I would say its very worth playing.",Recommended,381,91.0 hrs on record,Posted: June 29

Yeah so about this game, you're wasting time reading reviews, you could be starting your first factory, but if you wish.

This game is possibly the best $24 dollars I have spent on a game. I can't stop playing it, I catch myself constantly thinking about how to improve the flow or make it look even cooler!
I have turned the ENTIRE desert into a glass terrarium-Factory, a factory in/on a terrarium **** IDK its awesome, it still wont lag or break.

There is so much to research, there is so much to explore, build and do. I can not stress to you the level of fun and SATISFACTION we are getting from this game. It is very rewarding and keeps your wanting to hit your next goal. There is a problem I get distracted because there is so much I want to do in the game. No limits I have found yet.

This is taking too long I must get back to my factory,I promise it will not let you down. Feel free to add me I'd love to help you get started, this much fun should be shared!

- Can I replay this game? You will enjoy many many hours.

- How is the satisfactory community? Well, They are the best !

- How are the graphics and how does the game run? The graphics are amazing, the game runs very smooth. It is in early access but the Devs are working very hard, it runs much better than what they say, which is good news for us, that means its going to be as close to perfect as they can.

- Are the Devs actively working on the game I see it has been in early access a while? They are the most interactive development studio I have had dealings with, you should tune in on Tuesday to watch the dev stream on Twitch. Jayce is quitting real soon but someone will be there.

- Would you recommend this game? All joking aside from earlier in my review, totally, this is a game that will give you hours and hours of fun. I have bought this for several friends and strangers, this game is so good it draws you in, you will want to share it with everyone.

- I read in reviews multiplayer is broken, is this true? No, this is an absolute untruth. Multiplayer works very well, and far better than the Devs give themselves credit for. The problem with multiplayer that you have read about in other reviews, is in the chair of the reviewer. Enjoy multiplayer as well, Play this game how you like.",Recommended,1870,336.6 hrs on record,Posted: June 29

A scanner that can be used to scan creatures/objects/items, provide little tidbits of info when you scan them, and have a progression system for it, the more stuff you scan, the more little rewards you can get, that kinda thing, like in No Man's Sky, I LOVE that system and I feel like this small thing would benefit this game a lot.

2. More weapons, I'm sure there will be more, as this is still considered early access..but I'm just saying~

3. No map limits, if we can see it, we should be able to go there. I don't like seeing the edge of the world, makes the map feel a little small. >.<

4. A more active enemy system, options to build turrets for base defense, spikes, bigger walls, gates, that kinda stuff. Having my base in the middle of a field with no threats to it on an alien planet definitely doesn't feel right, in my honest opinion. I know the game is more centered on building, and people may like having a peaceful environment, but adding difficulty options at least, like peaceful/hostile environments would awesome, kindof like how the Valheim enemy system works. :)

5. A radio that we can load songs into somehow so we can listen to some tunes as we build and explore!

6. Player housing, nothing massive, just a personal little house you can decorate! Would mean a lot.

7. Let us sleep in beds/sit on chairs. :>

8. Minigames on the computer within the HUB? Just a thought!

9. Let us climb the space elevator. >=(

Nonetheless, amazing game. Still having fun and doing my own thing, amazing stuff!",Recommended,1366,20.4 hrs on record,Posted: June 29

Game not bad at all, but i have a lot experience in this kind of games and love them but saw much much better.
Problems:
1) Oversize buildings - Early start game when game asking you to build space elevator... Bigger then my screen Assemblers, Furnace, constructors etc.... Only Hub have normal size in game over player size. Why they can't split mega building in to few pieces. And build them step by step...
2)Base building turns into torture due to the huge dimensions of buildings. You need build large platform in air for hold start base. Ramps don't have base soo it's looks like UFO. Walking simulator around you base.
3) Tech tree - Game at the beginning requires you to explore world search for power slugs. Ability to fly open at tier 6.... Walk around map and build conveyer belts everywhere such an awesome idea.
4)Сollision - game have a lot problems with it. Belts, pipes cross each other it's looks terrible for this sort of game. Spaghetti. Hello Factorio o/ <3<3<3
Same problem with Flora if you build building game not destroying trees & bushes. Tree in the middle of assembler looks rerrible.
5)Energy management. Last few years in base building games i see same problem. People who make this probably have no idea how electricity works. Thin copper wire that powers the entire base. Also beginning phase power poles have just 4 connections. in, out and 2 connections... Pole forest !
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This game don't have almost anything similar to Factorio BUT it's pretty bad copy of 2 mods for minecraft
GregTech 5+MineFactoryReloaded.
Gregtech 5 mod for my opinion still the best TechBaseBuilding simulator in 3d. Satisfactory atm have max 10% of it's content.
13hours in this game to 10k hours in Gregtech4 of nonstop building and planning (Automatization of Oil refinery blow your mind).
(I rly give up to wait, soo last few hours played x20 Cheat Engine boost just for see what have tier 5-6 elevator.)

If they make multiblock structures similar like have Gregtech addon GT++ allowing to build your self multi structures and decided where to build imput, outupt, energy, fluid hatches it's can change general feeling of game. Also decreese basic machines size at least to 6x6 based on ramps size 8x8.
Game not worth to play atm. Let's see how it's gona be in relese. But probably no!",Not Recommended,2011,13.2 hrs on record,Posted: June 29

Amazing factory building game with good graphics. The visuals remind me of No Man's Sky. There aren't really any survival elements to the game which is enjoyable and allows you to focus on just the building. It is easy to get lost in the game for hours since the pacing is good and you can go from one goal onto the next very easily. Later in the game it becomes more difficult to do things solo as the amount of work increases exponentially, but it is still very fun. I'm excited to see how the next update improves the game even further.",Recommended,456,32.3 hrs on record,Posted: June 29

I rarely ever give a review out for games, but for this one, I know I had to.

First things first, this game is beautiful. Coffee Stains Studio should be so proud of the stunning and captivating environments they've been able to produce! Whether you're under the heat of a vast and sparse desert, or relaxing on the coast line underneath an alien tree, you're going to find something to love in this game.

Secondly, the game play is nearly perfect. Sure, there are some areas of the map that you might wander into that lead to a dead end (or in a couple of cases me falling through the map) but those instances make up 0.00000000000001% of your game play experience. Coffee Stain Studios have truly perfected the Open-World-Survival Sim theme and executed it in the most satisfactory (hehe) way possible.



Buy this game. Do yourself a favor and sink into the immersion and the details that these wonderful devs have made. From this game alone, I will forever be a Coffee Stain Studios fanboi.",Recommended,841,482.5 hrs on record,Posted: June 29

I love the chill factor in this game. Though it seems the end goal is basically unknown, I find hours have passed by doing things to progress or make your in game life more enjoyable, like beautification or streamlining. I have spent loads of time doing next to nothing in game and somehow have had a great time. The mod-friendly nature of this developer allows customizing that make the game adjustable for almost any preferred play style. The difficulty level increases exponentially as you progress so be warned, this is NOT a 40 hour game. it's a world and will take worldly amounts of time to reach the highest tiers which at this point doesn't even reach an ""ending"", but that's not the point of Satisfactory, The point is to build, explore and make the planet your playground.",Recommended,664,401.9 hrs on record,Posted: June 28

Hi, I have been playing this game for a while now and it seems very fun in the beginning, but once you get better at the game and complete all the tires, the game slowly begins to be a bit boring. You can always expand your buildings and structures, but in my opinion, it's not as fun as if you just started, even if you try one of the other 4 maps you can choose from. Overall very well-made game, keep updating it and make it bigger, and perhaps some other creative maps that would switch it up a bit.",Recommended,422,217.5 hrs on record,Posted: June 28

It is a really nice game if you like to get things REALLY organize and in place.

If you like to craft things, explore open world, store large quantity of items in an organize fashion and you think you may or may not have a certain degree of OCD.
Then, I believe you have found the right game. I bought this game because of its conveyor belts and it has not disappoint me. Hehehe ~

There are flaws as the game is still developing, it will be not as smooth as the host for those who are joining the server.
Like, the plants that had been chopped down will reappear and wouldn't go away for those who are joining. But, for the host that area is actually cleared.

Oh btw ~ this game is not storyline intensive, so do take note on that.

All in all, it is a really great game with some noticeable hiccups. Hope that the devs will fix the multiplayer issues soon.",Recommended,719,136.7 hrs on record,Posted: June 28

Warning! If you would like to have a safe and healthy life by not having a video game direct your life, then this isn't the game for you; it is that addicting in my opinion.

I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes to watch machines work for them and just loves automation. There really isn't much more that I can say about this game; it is that good.

Just within the first 2 days of owning this game, I have never felt a feeling of such satisfaction by playing a video game and branching out an industry of large proportions. I hate grindy games, but this game gives a sense of high accomplishment for doing grindy tasks.

For anyone familiar with Minecraft Modpacks that revolve around anything technology based, this isn't like anything you've seen; it is actually fun to build machines and automation processes without hassel of having to beat around some other bush to gather materials for one simple machine.

If anyone has played NMS, this game gives a vibe with it, but with its own creative spin. No stupid Alchemic processes of turning X into Y, then Y into Z, no dumb story that makes you run around like a headless chicken, and no stupid power required to actually run storage systems.

As a closing to this cluster review, I believe the best characteristic of this game that gives it such a good feeling of progression is that you really don't need any walk-through's, wiki's, or a discussion site to actually play the game. You can still use these sources, but you rarely will need them; I've only gotten stuck once and needed Wiki help for obtaining an item.",Recommended,1323,51.7 hrs on record,Posted: June 27

zack1stplayer,https://steamcommunity.com/id/zack1stplayer/,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
This game has a bunch of random mechanics that are fun individually , but as a factory building sim I can't say that it's really that great. Honestly, Factorio is just a better factory construction game and feels more gratifying to play, this game really doesn't hit the same notes. Whenever I finish some part of my factory in this game I just think ""Thank Gaben that's been dealt with"" rather than ""What's next?"" like Factorio. The game has no core drive for me, it doesn't really feel fun to build new facets of my factory, it just feels like a chore. The infinite resources means there's no conflict to drive you forward and build elsewhere, you just build and then let it sit on it's own for 5 Hours until you finally reach the next research threshold and can move on to... doing the exact same thing, again... ... It's really not that great, especially since I'm comparing it to a Titan like Factorio.

I hope this game can improve in the future, as individually its parts are fun, but as a whole... It's definitely less than the sum of its parts...

5/10, like exactly dead average overall, individual mechanics would be better served in a better, more satisfactory, game.",Not Recommended,989,44.4 hrs on record,Posted: June 26

Wow... One of the best game i played ever.
If u like optimization, reflection and farm, this game is made for you.
Difficulty level is perfect, not too easy, not impossible, but u need to use your brain though.
You got the desire to progress, and many fetures make the game more pratical conserning recipes and needs.
There is frequent update during this early access.
Multiplayer has a few issues, and there is of course bugs in this game, But none of them prevents you from playing and enjoying.
The only problem is that the map always the same, so it reduce the lifetime of this game, one game last for 100h before being really complete, but you can change start biomes to discover another part of this beautiful game.
Very addicting though, good luck controlling your time

Would definitely recommend it.

A great game for people who like automation games which need you to spend hours trying to make everything streamline. The game also has got its challenges like when you have the animals which want to kill you when you are going into their areas but that also adds to the game's challenge and makes you think about how to get around them. Another aspect of the game which makes it challenging is the power management and how you have to make sure you have enough power for what you want to do and if you have enough resources to make the power stations work so you have enough power. This game is very well made and I would advise people who like these types of games to get this one.",Recommended,571,19.3 hrs on record,Posted: June 25

This has potential to be a great game. Subnautica meets Factorio, what's not to like? There are many things the devs have done right, and a few that need work, but for an early access game, it's definitely a recommendation from me.

What works:
- Visuals are great.
- Factory building is very enjoyable, the models are simply amazing and the core systems are fun.
- Technology progression feels rewarding so far.
- Exploration is surprisingly good for a factory-building game. The decision to avoid procedurally generated maps and go for a few hand-crafted worlds is the right one here, and the maps are fantastic, although rather small. They are interesting to explore and invoke a sense of wonder.
- Surprisingly few glitches for early access. Aside from some placeholder items here and there, I wouldn't be able to tell right away that it's not a finished product.

What needs work:
- The major issue that bugs me personally is complete lack of an end-game goal. Without something to look forward to the game feels pointless. This is subjective, but I prefer my sandbox games to give me something big to work towards, even if it's superficial like in Minecraft. Maybe I've missed something, but I'm halfway through the technology tree and I still have no clue why I'm building all this stuff. Bugs the hell out of me.
- Balance needs some work. E.g., until you hit the coal power (which is pretty late if you don't know what you're doing in advance), power management is a major hassle as you're forced to constantly cut trees for fuel, which feels like a grind. In a way, it's good that the game forces you to do it early on to encourage exploration, but to my taste it does it too much.
- Buildings placement in 3D is fiddly. I think something like easily adjustable snap-to-grid scale setting would be very useful.
- For a game of complex flowsheet management it lacks the tools to visualize it. I'd love to see some in-game screens that would allow to understand what is not working at a glance.
- Lack of some kind of blueprint system to allow for simpler base expansion. This is a highly requested feature, which as I understand the devs are not keen on implementing. It doesn't bother me too much personally, but I know many people suffer without it.

Mind you, none of these issues prevent me from having a ton of fun with this game.",Recommended,1958,92.3 hrs on record,Posted: June 24

it mixes a lot of elements of games i like. beautiful open worlds, lots of content, and freedom to sandbox with objectives you can do in any way you want. there's no right way to make a rotor factory, no right place to put your hub... but there is inbuilt challenge to improve your designs and devise more effective or cleaner versions of your factory. the game makes you think, and is beautiful to boot. It really is a gem of an experience.
this game was gifted to me by a friend. despite me getting the game free i'm gonna be honest, i'm probably gonna buy the game twice if some people i had in mind want to play too :)",Recommended,545,33.9 hrs on record,Posted: June 24

Have been playing fro over 1200 hours and there is still so much to do, build and explore.

It is clearly not a finished game, there are ingredients that have no uses, areas where performance needs improvement and lots of little issues here and there. But all of that is so easy to ignore as you start building and growing your factories and regular patching and updates gives a great indication these issues will be resolved as the game heads towards a full release version.

It's a factory building game like Factorio. In contrast to Factorio this game has a fully realized 3D world and this is a problem. The main game loop revolves around building various factory elements and the 3D world makes it difficult and tiresome to build those. In the 2D world of Factorio the act of lining up the buildings or removing swaths of constuction elements is easy and here it's a chore. You will spend some time designing your factory and a lot of time trying to align a conveyor belt against a constructor or something like that. The 3D nature of the world and FPS aspect of the game make it very unpleasant experience.",Not Recommended,539,10.9 hrs on record,Posted: June 24

Game is incredibly addicting. Completing one portion of your factory unlocks new potential for more and more lines, which then double back and allow you to work on building the efficiency of your already existing line. Game has got a bit of jank on it, but nothing game breaking, just some goofy clipping and materials in game that have no use (which helpfully tell you they have no use as of yet). Movement feels very good, problem solving results in satisfying conclusions. A great big world to explore and so much iron to mine. I can see myself spending hundreds of more hours into this, and the devs seem to be actively working on more content.

If you enjoy base building, problem solving, creating efficient systems and watching things go past on conveyor belts, you'll enjoy this game.",Recommended,674,34.2 hrs on record,Posted: June 24

**WARNING**
VERY ADDICTING GAME, PROCEED WITH CAUTION (just kidding, play your heart out)

I personally find this game very addicting, with the well planned out building mechanism, i can can dwell my self in the world of a factory that is build with your very own imaginations. there is so much possibility in this game, from train stations to building a humongous factory from scratch, this is the best game to dwell in, i would personally play it for 6-8 hours per session, sometimes i even hit the 12 hour mark, all i can say is, its a very addicting game, well made.

Experiencing the flavors of choice and exploration, followed by a scent of micromanagement and aftertaste of accomplishment, Satisfactory has become my drink of choice when I indulge alone. While there is an acquired taste on the tedious side of it, its easily mitigated by the sensations I've come to love in this extremely giving cocktail of a game.

I recommend a purchase of the title at your earliest convenience, especially if you enjoy casual resource management and expansion of productions.

There are times where I absolutely hate this game. The random frame rate hiccups have lead to my death (multiple times). Once you get past a certain sized base, the game can really start to chug (to the point of unplayable). I have also encountered a weird glitch where when I exit the game, the game doesn't actually shut down. It continues to run in the back ground, and I cannot shut it down without restarting Steam.

Then there are SO many parts of the game I love. Everything is your creation. Whether your base works or fails it's all on you. And it feels SO GOOD to have your plans and designs work. It's a wonderful and addicting gameplay loop. The updates are regular and often substantial. The atmosphere is great, and the world can feel foreboding and mysterious.

This game can endlessly piss me off, but I have so much fun with it, I'm more than willing to put up with the issues, and I feel like the developers will get this game finished and polished.

In short, there are points where I pause, look at the world and what I've created, and think ""Wow. I can't believe this is still in early access."" And then my character gets stuck in a rock and I think ""Oh yea. This game is in early access.""

Do you have OCD?
Yes: Well you'll love this game because tediously designing, micromanaging, min/maxing, adjusting and readjusting your factory will satisfy even the most meticulous of people.
No: Don't worry, the game is forgiving enough/free enough to allow for total spaghettification of your designs... just don't expect it to be easy to find things down the line.

Do you like stunning visuals?
Yes: Well you're in luck, complete with beautiful scenery, high texture quality, and even lense flare this game is graphically quite stunning.
No: mmm IDK, try Minecraft maybe?

Do you like active combat?
Yes: Well this probably isn't the game for you, there is PVE combat, and you could even say it's virtually essential to progress in the game, it isn't the core intention of the game, there are things to kill yes (as mentioned things you pretty much have to kill, yes), and there are melee and firearms, but not many, and none are particularly powerful and satisfying to a violence addict.
No: See above, you will need to fight things most likely, I can't imagine a method of play that doesn't involve killing some creatures, but don't worry, you aren't going to be on a battlefield.

Do you like Spiders?
Yes: Oh good! Then you'll love the caves...
No: Well no worries, you can turn them into.... kittens? Nasty, mean little kittens...

Overall:
Game directive: Creative building and design, encourages creative engineering to build a factory capable of achieving several goals.
Rating: A+ for visual qualities, beautiful scenery, realistic machinery, most graphical elements of this game are top notch.
Rating: A for Control interface/User Interface, although most things are relatively intuitive and movement feels smooth, dynamic, and predictable, there are some aspects of the controls that aren't exactly well explains, such as stack splitting, etc... honestly just look up the controls, it's not Arma 3 complicated or anything, but there are a few controls that the average user may not even know exist.
Rating: A+ for depth of gameplay, honestly you can sink easily over 500 hours into a single factory and still not be fully ""satisfied"" (although personally I only get about 50 hours into a factory before my ADD kicks in and I move on to something else, but I come back repeatedly)
Rating: A for replayability, there is only 1 map, but the map is in all honesty, absolutely huge, there are 4 main starting locations and with some hiking you can choose your own starting location by just breaking down your escape pod and walking for a bit, however there are probably some places that will be difficult if not impossible to use as a start location due to 1: impassible terrain until later in the game, 2: potential baddies between you and where you want to go and/or 3: access to basic resources that are definitively required for progress on nearly any level of the game. To be frank I have restarted the game 4 times and loaded into all but 1 of the 4 starting areas (I visited the other one in one of my previous games and it's a bit creepy there, so I don't want to live there...) and despite restarting the game that many times I have yet to traverse the whole map, but the developers did do a great job of gently encouraging you to visit other areas by spreading out end-game resources.
Early Access Rating: A+ (some may not share this view), as opposed to releasing frequent yet unimpressive updates the developers have chosen to use large scale updates less often, they roll bug fixes quite regularly, but full feature updates are generally fewer in number, but great in overall addition to the gameplay. As far as the state of the game goes I have to say every aspect of the game that is in play right now feels finished minus a few odd items here and there (the odd thing that doesn't have sound attached to it for example, like construction of a vehicle), but otherwise the playable elements of the game right now, feel complete and well polished. We're so used to ""Early Access"" games being a catch all phrase for under developed and unfinished crap with no curb appeal or at the very least several massively game breaking bugs, Satisfactory is not one of those games.

Pros:
-good graphics
-well designed maps, beautiful + no out of place clipping etc.
-amazing game play, especially if you're mechanically inclined.
-very easy to setup multiplayer, was able to jump right in with no issues.
-no major bugs or glitches that I've had to experience yet.

Cons:
-not very many different maps, which I would assume can cause game play to eventually stagnate. [Edit] At the time of making this I didn't realize there was only one map. But I see now that it is a large single map, with many possibilities. So if it's a negative or not is in the eye of the beholder.

Maybe could add variants of ore etc. to add a splash of variation to the game, but other than that I can't think of anything I dislike.

Overall, I think this game provides a mechanically/statistically challenging environment in a way that still offers the relaxation and entertainment of playing a video game you enjoy. Would definitely recommend. 8.5/10",Recommended,810,111.1 hrs on record,Posted: June 23

SirNarax,https://steamcommunity.com/id/SirNarax/,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
It is a high quality game but Factorio is its' superior in quality and technicality. Satisfactory is good if you played a lot of Factorio and want something new otherwise stick with or play that game. Because of the inclusion of the 3rd dimension building something as simple a conveyor belt can have a lot of depth in comparison to Factorio but as a tradeoff it is much more sluggish and tedious especially at first. Progression in this game is slow and not incredibly gratifying in comparison to Factorio where even early on it feels rewarding to get machines to work in this it is just connect the dots. They put too much emphasis on the later stages of the game.

A really unfortunate part of this game however is the performance problems, framerate can dip from time to time but mainly I mean the poor performance when playing online with friends. If two people living a few blocks from each other with really great internet and decent systems can't even walk around without horrific latency you have a problem. It is unacceptable how poorly this stuff works. For some reason as well your character is saved on the cloud so if for whatever reason you try to play your world when you are offline you will find your inventory is wiped and vise versa. It thinks online you and offline you are two different characters which is beyond stupid.

So in short play Factorio instead unless you played all you can of that game and want something new.",Recommended,1207,9.2 hrs on record,Posted: June 22

Satisfactory is a game that appears to be a direct descendant of Factorio, in that the primary challenge and the main point of the game is to create factories and supply lines between them that would wring the planet out of its natural resources and turn them into technological products that you need to create more sophisticated factories, more efficient supply lines, and more cool gadgets for personal use. On that front, Satisfactory delivers while still being in deep Early Access, there's hundreds of hours of content.

What puts it apart from other similar games, by which I mostly mean Factorio, is that Satisfactory puts you in the first-person perspective in a very gorgeous and vertical world. There are so many hidden nooks and crannies to find while scaling monumental mountains with waterfalls falling into the mist below. The real joy of Satisfactory comes from its movement: by creating the gargantuan machine of your factory, you create an environment for yourself to traverse, and boy is it ever a joy to traverse it. Electric ziplines, exoskeletons, parachutes, and jetpacks are all valuable additions to your character, who gets to bullet jump like in Warframe and slide under conveyor belts. It is so far removed from the central point of the game, but the game would be so much worse off if it wasn't included. If you're reading this, you probably know all about the factory-building aspect, but there is a lot more to this game than conveyor belts and iron plates.",Recommended,1257,22.4 hrs on record,Posted: June 21

This game has been on my radar for a bit. There was no way in hell I was going to buy it during its Epic exclusivity period, so I waited for the Steam release. While the game is still in early access, it's certainly more feature complete than a majority of other titles in that category can boast.

Anyway, what do I think? It's good; addictive. It's easy to come across production issues and have to problem-solve around them to squeeze maximum efficiency out of your setups. It's also common to find yourself tumbling down rabbit holes of exponentially expanding production possibilities. For example, I went into a rebuild of my current manufacturing base, expecting only to increase steel and component throughput. I'm now finding myself demolishing everything in that base because I realized I wasn't maximizing my miners. It's opened up a ridiculous list of ways my production efficiency is about to increase, and I'm not even optimal yet.

If you like to obsess over details and squeeze every single bit of efficiency out of things, this game will likely not disappoint you.",Recommended,918,83.8 hrs on record,Posted: June 21

its easy and its really fun and challenging to me if i choose a hard map but there is two things i don't like one personally i think its basicly impossible to not be chased by at least one creature in the first 10 minutes of the game second i really want to just have fun and do races with my friends but i cant because i need to get resources to make stuff so i really want a sandbox mode so when you make update 5 please add in a sandbox mode or at least make a mode where you don't have to research so you have all the research unlocked instantly please",Recommended,461,34.5 hrs on record,Posted: June 21

A very addicting and visually stunning game!

It is without a doubt the best automation-management game out there, dyson sphere program being a close second, Satisfactory will come to define the genre for some time.

It is in early access but the game already feels like a functional and polished experience up until the end game as it is right now, but based on the quality so far I'm excited to see how the game will thrive when it is complete.

About the game in the game description on Steam,

""Satisfactory is a first-person open-world factory building game with a dash of exploration and combat. Play alone or with friends, explore an alien planet, create multi-story factories, and enter conveyor belt heaven!""

If this even peaks your interest, just buy the game. Progressing to the next tier feels so exciting and brings factory defining changes to the game. Unlock new tier, see what is going to make it 10x better and more efficient, get excited and scrap your current factory to build a bigger one!

The game is so satisfying! If you have a sliver of OCD, you will drain countless hours making the perfect factory where everything has the tightest turns.

This game is super fun to play if you like base building and the terrain looks great. My only problem with this game is that the performance is not very optimized. If your going to be building large structures your game is going to lag and or crash. The minimum system requirements are not nearly enough to play the game. In the minimum system requirements section they said that you need to have a 2G graphics card to play the game. I have a 4G graphics card and my game doesn't look like a game. It looks like a slideshow of pixels moving across my screen so if you're going to play this you're going to need a beefy graphic card for your experience to run smoothly.",Recommended,560,544.5 hrs on record,Posted: June 19

Love the game, BUT!!!... They made it necessary to have one power plant per functional building. This makes your base a MUCH, MUCH bigger and very cumbersome to try to lay out in a way that is reasonably functional and navigable... I would LOVE to see that particular requirement altered to allow a MINIMUM of 2 functional buildings ran from each power plant (preferably 4 or more), especially when it comes to the ""In-line"" pumps. They are small enough we should be able to hook 5 or 10 of those to a single power source. Multiple electrical connections are the norm EVERYWHERE else! Why not here? With the size of the buildings in this game, any one you can avoid having to build 20 or 30 (or more) of is very helpful.",Recommended,607,373.1 hrs on record,Posted: June 17

If you are a fan of Factorio, you will LOVE this game. If you are not a fan of Factorio, you will LOVE this game. Okay, maybe not LOVE, but there is still a lot to like about Satisfactory. First of all, it is still in Early Access and there is sooo much to do. You will likely not finish all the tiers before the next update, which will bring even more content. There is not even a story mode yet, but there is story mode promised in a future update, and frankly, I don't see how they can fit it in with all the other stuff to do. My factory is a tangled mess, but that's just how I play. I still love tearing down what I have and rebuilding it. Don't get me wrong...you don't have to tear everything down and rebuild. There are ways to play without completely redesigingin everything, but if that's what you want to do, hey, go for it.

Satisfactory is such a fun game that I always find myself coming back to. Anyone who likes factory games such as Factorio will probably love Satisfactory as well. Unlike many factory building games, Satisfactory is first person, making it even more satisfying to step back and watch as your factories grow. The main gamplay of building your factory and advancing your technology is very fun, because you can put in the time to carefully plan out your factory and make it look clean and organized, without it becoming overly tedious. On top of factory building, Satisfactory also has an element of world exploration which can serve as a nice break if you want to focus on something other than building factories for a while. The world exploration is well done because it allows you to explore the rather large map and see all the interesting and beautiful biomes, while also getting Hard Drives which give you valuable alternate recipes for your production lines. On top of the fun core gameplay, Satisfactory can also be played in singleplayer or multiplayer. I find the game to be fun in singleplayer, but even more fun if a couple of friends join your world. One thing to note is that if you join a multiplayer game you often experience more bugs than in singleplayer, but these bugs are almost never game-breaking and can normally be fixed by rejoining the world. Also, the game is still in early access and is quite smooth considering it is not fully released. Satisfactory also seems to never get old. I have put many hours into the game and still plan to put in many more. I constantly think about future factory plans and have loved every second of playing the game. In all, Satisfactory is a very fun and satisfying factory game that I would recommend to anyone who already likes factory games, or to anyone who hasn't played a factory game and wants to try out the genre.",Recommended,1568,291.0 hrs on record,Posted: June 16
RemoteLeg,https://steamcommunity.com/id/RemoteLeg/,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Satisfactory is an excellent game for people who like building bases. It's all about building.
Having said that, I must say the world is gorgeous. It's an alien planet with multiple moons and a day-night cycle. There's lots of terrain to explore in search of raw materials and some local fauna to battle for control of territory, though combat is only a small part of the game.
The interface is also very good. There's something intuitive about pointing where you want to build something then seeing all the materials fly from your person to that spot and assemble the building in seconds. It just feels right.
The focus is always on building your factories bigger and better. Rerouting the endless streams of conveyor belts to be more efficient and watching them march long lines of materials across the landscape to be gobbled up by your ever-hungry factories. Ship your products off to your overseers in space to unlock more building schematics then build your factories bigger and better than before.",Recommended,856,277.5 hrs on record,Posted: June 16

This game is very fun and extremely ""satisfactory"". Most of this game is not in completing challenges, but in creating more efficient and beautiful factories. This is where the gameplay shines as you have to figure out what is holding back your machines and rebuilding time and time again to keep up with your resource demand.

I highly recommend this game to anyone who wants an amazing base builder and a lot of extra hours to put into it.

The only thing I can say against this game is the lack of optimization for multiplayer and the lack of being able to run a dedicated server. But from what I hear, these issues are being worked on (even if they are not the highest priority).",Recommended,579,134.3 hrs on record,Posted: June 16

The first 3-4 hours of this game are INSANELY fun. You learn how to play the game, you fend off hostile animals, and you automate everything, which is SO satisfying. It's one of the most fun game intros I've ever played through. But after that, you run out of things to do. It gets really boring. You just automate and craft so you can get more milestones so you can automate and craft more. If the devs are reading this, I'd recommend adding some more challenge and interest to the game past the intro.",Recommended,428,8.9 hrs on record,Posted: June 16

happylabs,https://steamcommunity.com/id/happylabs/,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
This game is a really fun and addictive automation factory-builder. The combat and exploration elements are pretty basic but kinda fun. There are some issues with scalability - there's no functioning blueprint system for example like factorio has, which means you end up spending a lot of time building big rows of production buildings and individually hooking up each one to input, output, and power. But I got a LOT of fun out of this game before this really started to bother me. I will also say that the hand-built map, while beautiful, limits replayability. It's quite unbalanced in terms of resource locations too. There is a particular spot that is essentially the objectively best place to start your factory to avoid having to make massive long-range transportation lines, so if you want to start fresh you're kinda short on reasonable alternatives to that spot without making everything more difficult than it needs to be.

Despite this review mostly consisting of complaints there is no way I would not recommend the game. Hundreds of hours of fun to be had even in it's current early access state.",Recommended,942,233.1 hrs on record,Posted: June 16

For an early access game, you can get literally thousands of hours of enjoyment from Satisfactory, and each new update will refresh your desire to play and build new and improved factories.

Pros: A great factori-like game. If things like limited resource nodes and lack of vertical building made you dislike factorio, satisfactory might be just up your alley.

Cons: still in devlopment means a number of odd quirks, bugs glitches and design decisions which are incredibly frustrating. The game can be great when it gets some more polish and it would be nice if there was nice place to post feedback/bug reports from in-game, not a fourm wich takes 20+ minutes to try to post something.",Recommended,431,107.3 hrs on record,Posted: June 15

Do not buy this game. It's a freaky time warp thing. You'll sit down after breakfast to play just an hour or two, you just want to tweak the efficiency on your power before you start your irl Saturday chores, then suddenly it's bedtime. You didn't even get to the power supply; you needed to fix the line feeding this thing into the space elevator, which brought you to the next tier, which allowed you to get the thing you've been just dying to get, plus your sink had enough tickets to get this thing you want, but now you need to feed pricier things into the sink to get the next cool thing, so you had to build a line feeding X thing in...

I have played over 500 hours on Epic. I have done multiple playthroughs of the content available in current early access. I really enjoy this game.

There is exploration. A whole seperate adventure that you can undertake at your pace.

There is building. Lots of building. Lots of freedom of how to setup your style.

There is fighting. But you can completely eliminate this if you dont want it.

The progression keeps going and feels rewarding.

This is not a high thrills game. This is best played at your own pace. For creative people you can really go out of your way to create ""pretty"" structures. For logical people. You can really be efficient about how you do stuff. I can recommend completing each stage fully before rushing onto the next thing.

I love open world sandbox games. Minecraft and redstone circuitry were always my favorite part of the game. Enter Satisfactory, where you can harvest and mine resources to build ever-increasing complexity contraptions! While there isn't a story mode yet, I love the ability to find new ways to build out my base and maximize my efficiency. The modding community around the game is awesome, providing both neat quality of life improvements (like the ability to monitor your factory efficiency and belt capacities, as well as whole new sets of building components to better align with what's being built) as well as functional changes with new components, like lift elevators that you can use to move vertically up and down your building without the need of hyper tubes.

My only complaint thus far about the game is that the map, while huge, is static. Every time you load up a new game, you'll be playing on the same map. The resource nodes are always in the same place, the collectibles are always in the same place, etc. If I could take the open world space exploration of a game like Elite Dangerous, the base building and terrain manipulation capabilities of games like No Man's Sky, and have the resource mining and factory simulation of Satisfactory, I'd never play another game again again.",Recommended,1096,83.1 hrs on record,Posted: June 14

Game is like factorio except bad. The game isnt about expanding its about waiting. There are limited resource nodes so all you can do is wait for the ridiculous grindy research points. You got a new tier of machine? rebuild your factory because why would we have a fun system!

In factorio you can actually expand and if you want the research to go faster you just. Expand.

Possibly the greatest early access game I've ever come across. Immeasurable content for an EA and damn near infinite potential for the game's future.

We all know it. We see Early Access and roll our eyes. The grim reminder in our libraries of how we got burned by trusting: ""The game will be finished soon, We promise this and that and all that absolutely soon"".

And then they are the glimpse of hope like Rimworld, or in this case Satisfactory.

Satisfactory, the satisfaction of developers to show others how to handle the brand of Early Access.

There is no nonsense roadmap with ""set in stone"" dates. You don't get meaningless updates every week to get you false hope of progress.
There is on other hand a good communication with community and lot of ways how to give feedback.
This whole thing is handled the satisfactory kind of way, the professional way.

The Good: it look satisfying, sounds satisfying. I have encounter single crash in SP (note on experimental branch), progress/exploration/fun factor, oh you know it = satisfying.

The Bad: MP is unstable, crashes a lot. Some visual issues - tied for me to AntiAliasing with foundations (fixed by turning it off, yet got blinded by sun reflection time to time).
Some small bugs and visual imperfection (tied to EA status) like certain equipment clipping and similar, but for me nothing game breaking and the game runs more smoothly than some AAA full released games (hello Batman).

So watch some LetsPlayes and if you are intrigued by this game, dont hesitate - As a rare gem, this game is worth your money as it was with mine. With a little bit of polish this game could be released and be worth more than it cost now.

I played 340+ hours, do you actually need to know anything else?
Okay, so this game is very addictive, offers such a rich variety of things to do, things to build, things to improve.
I mostly play together with a friend and we rarely run into any issues (trains a bit tricky to handle for the client). However, we ran into some performance issues recently but to be fair, our factory is quite large – I wonder what the total length of our conveyor belts is. The developers are updating this game constantly, so I'm sure they'll find a way to fix the remaining bugs easily :)

I would honestly buy this game a second and a third time to support this game and the developers further (which I actually do by gifting it to friends on their birthdays :D).",Recommended,632,412.1 hrs on record,Posted: June 14

I got this game, at first I was like ""oh this is gonna be a game I can play casually"" welp, got it a few days ago and now 100 Hours, damn..

This game is amazing because:
You can get MODS!
You can modify this game with more Mods like new Power-Sources etc!!!!!

You already can spent days,weeks by building your fantastic and good looking Megabase, Train-Stations and so on.
I spent over 30 hours building a good looking Logistic System which is also functioning really well ;)

This game is receiving Updates so Content will come!
Mods are also comming, people develope mods and even ask for Opinions, or Ideas!


It is worth it to buy Satisfactory and In my opinion I would say:
Satisfactory is a really good game and it's worth every single penny!

Keep in mind this game has bugs, but it's in the early access phase so once this game is fully done you can expect this game to have more features, mods etc etc.",Recommended,772,173.9 hrs on record,Posted: June 14

One of the most polished (even for early access!) 3D factory builder games, with a lovely handcrafted map to adventure around in. Best played with friends, so you can sword-fight with Xeno-Bashers, accidentally run each other over, and eventually make a successful factory.

And then cry when you realize you need to uproot the whole thing to make room for new assembly lines, of course.

If you like games such as Factorio or Mindustry, you'll enjoy this game. This is a bit more of a passive and semi-peaceful take on those concepts of hostility with the aliens you encounter.

Absolutely phenomenal mechanics between machines, except for liquids those can be glitchy and difficult at times (or I just don't understand how liquid is actually supposed to work). The biggest headache you'll have is the logistics of getting material where you need it.

No way around it, this is just an excellent game. A must-have for anyone who enjoys Factorio. It's well-polished. Like, every machine has it's own special animation polished. Placing down large buildings feels amazing and truly like you are getting more powerful as you progress through the game. It is addicting, and keeps you engaged.

My only complaint is how grindy the super super late game gets. And by that, I specifically mean the Assembly Director System. At this point in the game I'm not motivated enough to manually place down all the parts required to make these in a decent amount of time. I basically just left the game idling at night for a few days. I'd like to see a tweak to that recipe or maybe automated factory construction.

Either way, I can't wait to see what this game becomes. Coffee Stain - you guys have something great on your hands. Keep up the great work!",Recommended,750,238.1 hrs on record,Posted: June 11

I want to say that this game is amazing and beautiful, and I plan on sinking many, many more hours into this game. That aside, there are some ideas, some useful and some aesthetic, that I think would make this game even cooler.

- Alarm systems. These can trigger sounds if you reach a certain threshold of power usage, items in a storage container, water reservoir depletion, pre-set time like a stopwatch, or have it constantly sounding the alarm. Bonus points if the alarm has a rotation light animation can be colored at the light control panel.
- Industrial decor. For example, cardboard boxes, crates, stacks of metal sheets, bundles of tubes, and pallet stacks to put these decor items on. This would be great for warehouse themed builds.
- Green decor. Planter beds, etc., for foundations. Trees, shrubs, flowers, etc., for the foliage decor. These can give further crafting uses to leaves, flowers, and wood.
- Computer system that catalogs your production, power usage per buildings (constructors, smelters, etc.) and panels (building blocks that go on walls) that can display whatever information you wish them to display.

Of course the devs can do and will do whatever they want, but I think these things would be cool. Either way, this game is great. Highly recommend.",Recommended,1090,62.0 hrs on record,Posted: June 11

I have never put in so many hours into a single game before. To say this game is addicting is an understatement. The developers at Coffee Stain studio have really outdone themselves on this one and have done extremely well listening to their customers and implementing good feedback. The graphics and open world are beautiful. The recipes and progression are well balanced. The first person shooter aspect brings a little challenge to keep things interesting. The story.........who knows, it's still in early access.

LOVED the game when I first got it. Very limiting once you get into the game however...but, of course, mods will fix that...right?

Wrong. Mods WILL fix that, but when an update comes out mods will screw with your factory so much that there's almost nothing left. NO communication between game creators and their mod creators whatsoever means you're screwed for months on end.

Even in ""Early Access"" this game is full of stuff. It's a factory game 0_0 where you take the role of an engineer sent to a planet to begin to exploit its resources. You begin with little more than your hands and a taser, but you work your way up to anywhere from several machines to entire factory floors as you see fit to get the job done.

Features: (first person), exploration, light combat, resource + production (factory) management, still getting awesome updates!

The game is awesome. Addicting, engaging (but not urgent) pace, great levels of abstraction, and a healthy dose of ""figure it out yourself"" lack of instruction later on. Perhaps that last point about the tutorials is because it's in test, but there's something satisfying about figuring out how to be an effective player on your own.

Cons: Really the only cons i have are with the current state, and it seems they've put off on some of the simpler issues to focus on mechanics. Things like:
- buggy af mobs
- haven't really implemented model collisions
- automated pathing buggyness
- plz default the cursor to the text form when selecting a search operation

current conclusion:
great work on the developers part, and the prioritization of the game feature rollouts. Can't wait to see what they add/patch next!",Recommended,700,112.9 hrs on record,Posted: June 10

So I'm leaving this as a don't recommend as the game needs to make some pretty major strides to be much more than ""grinding in 3D Factorio"". There's basically no challenge unless you do what I did and travel far, lose your starting weapon and then build next to enemies... Then you'll spend an hour being miserable just because you can't defend yourself.

Other than that... I just don't see where the challenge is. There's no real presence to work against. Like in Factorio (which was also too easy in my opinion) at least there's a growing enemy presence that attacks you.

Its a very pretty game, and has loads of potential... But its just not there yet.

I think once we get some sort of real enemy the game will be a lot more fun and something you'll want to play with friends. Right now... Its kinda like playing Forge in Halo alone... Its cool... You can do cool things but there's no challenge.",Not Recommended,759,3.1 hrs on record,Posted: June 9

This game is my Minecraft redstone automation dreams on crack with great graphics to boot. 48 hours in and only crashed once, for an early access game it exceeded my expectations and the environment is beautiful. Being my first proper factory-building game, I expected it to feel grindy and very focused around the factory aspect, but it didn't feel tiring at all. Keeping things neat is my priority but I'm not too overly fussed about it, you can basically go as crazy as you want to. A lot of room for different playstyles! I got addicted to automating things so that I got time to go out and explore for resources. I just started on trains and oh my god... You're telling me I can build an entire train network on this map? Now I'm REALLY obsessed. I close my eyes and I see conveyor belts. I'm constantly thinking of what to name my next train station.

This game is very fun. I got it like yesterday and already have 10+ hours. Very addictive, lets you use your head a lot, and as the game progresses you get to see your hard-worked creation spring to life. I was hesitant to get this game for a while, I didn't see the fun in running conveyors all the time. That isn't what this game is though. You get to use your head, think about problems and solutions, and just have a great time. One of the biggest downsides to his game is the story. I don't really mind it, but if you like games with a lot of story and lore I would not recommend this. Why are you on this planet? Who is FICSIT? Why are you sending resources into the sky to unlock new things? To make him rich? If you really want story to a game don't get this one, but if you just want something that will get you going for hours, totally get this. And who knows, this is in early access currently, so maybe the game will change in the full release.

I kept waiting for this game to be fun, but most of it is sitting at a crafting menu with your mouse button held down by your headphones for 30 minutes so that you can get a slightly faster conveyor belt. Everything is tedious to do, until you play the game for a super long time to get everything automated, which at that point the game isn't even a game. It's still just sitting there, waiting for resources to pile up so you can unlock slightly faster conveyor belts, letting you make faster automation for the same purpose. It's just a cycle of boring grinding. The exploration of the world basically consists of standing at your base waiting to unlock a scanner upgrade, using the scanner, making a beeline to the ore that you scanned for, and going back to base after setting up a miner for the ore. I can see how people might be able to have fun with this with friends, but it's so overpriced that you would have a hard time convincing them to essentially get an idle game. I liked astroneer, which is also an automation game, but in astroneer, you're dealing with about 5 resources at a time, tops. In this game, some of the objectives are something like ""get 2500 copper wire"" which takes about 20 minutes to even craft. They're obviously different games, but for the same price one is so much less tedious than the other. There's clearly been lots of planning, time, and care put into all the aspects of the game, but it's just not fun, and it doesn't do enough with its expansive map until far too late in the game.",Not Recommended,1262,20.6 hrs on record,Posted: June 8

Wonderful visuals and well paced progression make this a very addictive game.

Although I have not finished the lush starter world (still have tier 8 & 9 to complete), I have to admit I'm thoroughly addicted by this promising early access game.

Visually, the game is stunning, and I'm constantly distracted by the unique panoramas the game has to offer. The various machines used to craft everything are interesting enough to keep you from being bored looking at your creations. Perhaps, the only thing I found clumsy was the limited shapes and lack of various textures for the foundation blocks.

As far as game play goes, there is a good mix of building manufacturing plants and transportation systems and the need to go exploring for new resources. However, I did find that it took way too long to get a decent weapon (rifle) but, apparently, you're supposed to be building stuff. I really like the various vehicles and personal enhancements you get as you progress. I can't wait to try the hover pack, and just hover around everywhere.

Satisfactory is definitely unique, but loses its charm relatively quick. The whole idea of automating resource collection over time is a great idea, but everything else about it kills the vibe. I'm sure they'll make more maps in the future but there's currently only 1 & it doesn't change... All nodes, enemies, etc are in the same locations, ""Multiplayer"" is severely lacking, has many bugs, & with extreme limitations of hosting it's almost impossible to have it run by a dedicated server. Based on gameplay Satisfactory was meant to be more of a singleplayer game since many of the bugs I've seen occur in multiplayer, but at this time I can't see myself playing solo since there's next-to-nothing else to do. There's really no ""exploration"" other than the map itself (no cave systems, etc), & ""survival"" is, well, there may as well be no enemies.

Do I recommend it? Not really. Until more gets implemented it sort of remains broken, & the unchanging map, along with lack of any story, makes multiple playthroughs quite monotonous & boring.

I gave it an honest try... 330 hours just trying different things. I had hoped to find something more than simply building the same stuff over & over... & over. I've since uninstalled it until a later date. I'll renew this review after 2022 when it's slated to leave early access. Perhaps bug fixes with multiplayer, an added storyline, a dedicated server option, implementation of the WIP devices, & more will peak my interest enough to keep me involved.",Not Recommended,1266,329.9 hrs on record,Posted: June 8

PedicaboEgoVos,https://steamcommunity.com/id/PedicaboEgoVos/,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
This is really one of those times where I wish Steam allowed something other than a simple yes/no. There's a lot that's really great here, but I can't recommend it in its present state.

I originally had a long essay detailing various frustrating experiences I had playing Satisfactory, but after reading back it just felt like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ about unfinished mechanics in a game that never purported to be anything but early access. Things like tedious and frustrating wheeled exploration in a tractor that handles like an overloaded zamboni. Or the perplexing lack of a noclip console command, when glitching into and getting stuck in terrain happens just about every game session. Or half-baked and poorly signposted game mechanics like getting caught in a ""Live, Die, Repeat"" scenario when I naively picked up some uranium ore and died instantly, then hiked my ass back to my corpse from a klick or so away, hit the ""grab all"" button in the looting UI, and died instantly again because no one outside the wiki bothered to tell me that having uranium ore in your inventory without a hazmat suit kills you in a zeptosecond. I did that maybe six times before I figured out about the ore, and had to basically do a save-scum routine to get all my stuff back.

All that said--and more besides, I assure you--I look forward to seeing where this game goes. The factory building itself is really well done. The act of building itself is very fluid and intuitive, and it's very absorbing setting up production lines and fine tuning both efficiency and use of space. The tech trees are very good at providing incentive to change up what you build and how you move and store things, and even though exploration is frustrating and more than a little chore-like, it IS gratifying to unlock a new resource and set up entire new processes for extraction, refining and manufacturing.

Also, I may be reading more into it than is there, but I think I detect a subtle sort of commentary about consumerism and the environment in the gameplay itself. You mine, transport and expand only so you can make more parts with which to mine, transport and expand. You run around ceaselessly looking for biomass to fuel your reactors, cutting down whole forests and denuding caves of mushrooms. You'll find yourself exterminating local fauna not because they drop precious resources, but because they're a nuisance when you're trying to build power transmission lines or resource-transporting conveyor belts. From what I can see, only certain resources have spawn rates, and for the most part plant and animal life is not among them. So eventually you'll see your factory at the center of a lifeless zone, forever expanding and assimilating everything in its path. It's damned clever if it's intended.

Altogether, I'd definitely say keep your eyes on it, but for now pick it up on a pretty steep sale, or if all the good stuff I mentioned seems worth the substantial frustrations of early access.",Not Recommended,2482,37.1 hrs on record,Posted: June 5

I've put way more time than I thought I would into an early access game, which I was not expecting. Each update makes the gameplay more solid, though there are still some goofy things (multiplayer bugs and whatnot) that they are working out. Even with the WIP stuff and bugs that pop up every once and a while, I highly recommend if you are a fan of games like Factorio and enjoy naming every weird landmark and also if you like designing a futurama hypertube transport system that spits you out 1 km above Splish Bish Lagoon that may or may not kill you",Recommended,469,91.7 hrs on record,Posted: June 5

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
This game is amazing, Just having the freedom to explore and build what you want fills me with so much happiness. The lack of intense fighting lets you just relax into the game, while still keeping your brain thinking with the complex (but awesome) crafting trees and the massive chains of machines. Don't feel like thinking? Gather bio fuel while still farming resources in the background.

morr507,https://steamcommunity.com/id/morr507/,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Factorio in 3D with a bit different mechanics. Some are better, some are worse. That is all what you need to know about this game.
All the advantages of this game are described in other reviews.

I want to point out four main flaws in the game that did spoil the gameplay for me.

1. Lack of challenge.
It has no Biters. Nothing threatens you, nothing to defend from. You just build for the sake of building. In time it becomes boring.
Of course there are hostile wild animals, but they do not possess any real threat. They also do not attack your buildings.
Biters are very essential part of the Factorio (I compare Satisfactory to Factorio because the core game mechanics are the same), which adds flavor to the the game and makes it much more interesting. Satisfactory lacks it, unfortunately.

2. Poor optimization for massive multilevel factories.
In the beginning of the game I had 90-120 fps. When I built my 3 floor factory my FPS dropped to 40-45. And I just climbed to Tier 5 out of 8.

3. UI for building is not really good.
You can't make any little adjustments to already built <anything>. You can't change angle, rotate or move. This is very annoying when you have to rebuild from scratch conveyors or electric poles because you initially incorrectly placed them on few centimeters.
Connecting conveyors in the distance is a pain. You have to point very precisely otherwise it wont connect or it will connect to the wrong direction.
Connecting power lines is also a pain. Until you research MK2 electric poles in pretty late middle game you are stick to poles with 4 connections which is a very frustrating. You have to put poles everywhere. It is so annoying.
No blueprints or tools for mass construction. Building large amounts of assemblies is mundane and repetitive.
And other minor issues that frustrates you.

4. The world around you is vast and beautiful but besides collecting energy slugs in reality you have no reason to explore it. Nothing to do there, nothing to collect there.",Not Recommended,1686,79.8 hrs on record,Posted: June 5

For people who are wondering if this game is worth buying, it is. This game is an early access, but is still pretty well optimised despite having a ♥♥♥♥ tons of items going through the entire map. If you like games where you progress with objectives and have everything automated, this game is what you are looking for. It doesn t require a ultra good pc setup, but the later you get in the game, if you want to add mods, you will need a decent config as it will lag more and more. The only major problems I have faced are with the train's time table and conveyor elevators (both in multiplayers) cause i was not the host, but honestly, the host can just fix it easily, so yeah. In this update, the problem is the lack of exploration: You do not need to explore at all. You can get everything with just the mam and just going to where the ressource you are looking for, and don't need to look around cause there is no real advantage to that. You can have hard drives, yeah, but not all of them are good, and most likely not necessary. I hate the dev who is in charge of monster spawning and management, i really hate you, you evil bastard. N.B.: I put this review as a bad one cause, if you are like me, you will go through the bad reviews first before buying a game, but i really recommend buying this game if you are into crafting, farming, automated games, and I mostly talk about the cons of the game, so yeah.",Not Recommended,1160,201.4 hrs on record,Posted: June 5

MediocreMaxi,https://steamcommunity.com/id/MediocreMaxi/,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
By far one of the most entertaining experiences for those who enjoy everything from base building to problem solving skills and resource management.

Despite being in only early access, this game has managed to capture my heart and my thorough, thorough appreciation. Breathtaking and absolutely beautiful scenery, incredible sound design, calming and melancholic music to go with the fairly low stress nature of the game, very few bugs (even less than many AAA games today), and the sheer amount of exploration and secrets to find makes this game an experience worth coming back to again and again.

As of the moment, my only real issue is connectivity issues when playing multiplayer, however, it does seem the developers are currently working on remedying those issues and, thus, I'd say that this game is still worth the pick up even despite this one shortcoming.

Definitely try this game out. Lots of content to sink your teeth into. Great relaxation from other high stress games out there right now.",Recommended,862,84.1 hrs on record,Posted: June 4

For an early access game - there is so much to do. I have almost 200 hours at the time of writing this, and I am nowhere near all the way through the content. Additionally, since it's Early Access, there's still plenty coming down the line eventually. The game has plenty to do, though, once you beat the game. You can build so much with their well-designed building system. It reminds me of Fallout 4's building system, but WAY better. You can be as messy or as neat as you want.

Way better than I’d anticipated! I went in thinking I’d tinker with it and probably get it refunded because so many space-based titles have failed to grab me. Building a factory sounded bland on paper, but this game is so much more than that. I like exploring, finding new materials, learning new things on the tech tree, and of course, making conveyor belt spaghetti.

2113740,https://steamcommunity.com/id/2113740/,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
I'm starting this review from when satisfactory is in early access, content is subject to change so if what you
see doesn't apply, updates may have changed the game. im going to be writing about satisfactory at different points in my playtime because
i hope that this will help with developers in seeing how a new player feels towards the game, but also the progression and change
of opinions.

13 hours into satisfactory v 0.4.2.6: Satisfactory is the first factory building game I've ever played. The closest comparisons to
Satisfactory i can make are Subnautica and No Mans Sky, both games that i love. If you like either of these games check out satisfactory.
I think Satisfactory is a gem of a game, parts of the gameplay like designing your own systems and picking up leaves are immensely
satisfying. around 6-7 hours into my playthrough i finished the space elevator tier one on the first world and its been really interesting.
The graphics are beautiful, the gameplay is engaging, its especially good when i just wanna idle for 10 minutes and be on my phone while
still progressing because i fueled the generators. the exploration is great because the environment is so visually engaging.

up until now i think i've been mostly spoiler free, but now heres a big SPOILER WARNING VVVVVVVVV everything from this point on will
be without concern for spoilers so beware

So while i love this game so far, i do think that there are some problems. of course there are, its in early access.
Right now, the combat is lackluster. i've fought four types of aliens and it isn't anything particularly special. the charging ones
can catch you by surprise but as long as you circle them you're mostly good. but sometimes, sometimes the charging ones bug out and
double, triple, or quadra tap you because they carried you with their charge. the fireball enemy is interesting, but immensely
challenging to dodge and kill effectively. the spider enemy is just a nuisance and the big charging enemy i was able to cheese by
just hiding behind a mushroom and getting it to come close while staying safe and tapping it. to be fair, ive only had my taser the
whole time and i know i can get better weapons but i just havent done so yet. I also haven't seen any hints at there being mobility
upgrades, and if there isn't any, its gonna be a real heartbreak for me because of how far i have to trek. even if i was able to spend
precious resources to temporarily boost my run speed, id take it.",Recommended,2074,13.8 hrs on record,Posted: June 1

sure, its been in early access for what feels like a decade now, but that game has so much content when it comes to the factory building aspect, so much time and effort went into creating logical mechanics that just, make sense.

I wish it's survival aspect was a bit more dynamic rather than take damage from bee or spider, spam eat raspberries, rinse and repeat

I knew from the moment I saw this on a Let's Play that I wanted to try it. I really cannot explain the appeal of factory games like this, but I know that when I see everything humming along and cranking out things it is a truly satisfying thrill-- hence the name! Plus the world you're exploring is genuinely pretty. The combat aspect against the local wildlife is a bit annoying at times, but the game does eventually give you enough tools to cope with it.

Satisfactory is a visually great game, a big map to explore, and lots of different geographical challenges that keep the map mysterious and exciting. Starting out with just minimal resources, and then building a warehouse of different machines was a big feeling of accomplishment, and when you have gathered enough resources, you can start to make it look visually appealing and functional which is one of my favorite aspects of this game. In other games once Ive started an automation project it is hard to want to change it, but here, I have cleared out and rebuilt the factory a few times to get the right production flow and it doesnt feel like Im starting all over. Great game, definitely recommend it, and I cant wait to see what the developers do with the updates.",Recommended,655,183.5 hrs on record,Posted: May 31

Having Pre-Purchased this game on Epic i played very little in the first year as i did not like getting killed every 5 minutes. Then i discovered the Passive Mod and have loved playing this game ever since. If you like building factories from small to Mega size this is your game. If you like being challenged and having to think your self around the large and never ending problems this is you game. Consisting of various types of landscapes, from flat to mountains, there is enough variations of starting areas for everyone. Priced very cheaply considering the endless hours you can indulge yourself. Also a very generous mod community and constant updates from the Devs, you will find this game very affordable, very enticing to play or should i say addictive, i can only say how much value and fun i have found this game.",Recommended,698,"1,245.8 hrs on record",Posted: May 30

Satisfactory has become my favorite game of all time. Been gaming since Pong was the only one. I have had my fill of running, shooting, and collecting gems. I enjoy building complex systems of manufacturing, transportation, and storage facilities. I have a traumatic brain injury and what I like about this game is that when my migraine headaches cripple me for a week at a time I can lose myself in this game for 6 - 8 hours with complete interest and focus. I can tear down a factory and rebuild it with a completely new design in an afternoon. This game allows me to feel like I can accomplish something really exciting, cool, and interesting all while my head is pounding away.

One of my favourite games of all time, everything about this game is great and I'd have over 3000 hours by now if they had implemented the dedicated servers they mentioned well over a year ago. I barely play anymore for the same reason, I originally got this to play with friends and unfortunately most of the time multiplayer has had it's bugs so we are STILL patiently waiting for dedicated servers. I can only hope they will release it soon (they said sometime after update 4) because we have been VERY patient waiting for the servers to come out and frankly it's getting to the point where it might be too late. Lots of great games are coming out this year and I would be sad if me and my friends moved on and lost interest in Satisfactory because of the amount of time they took to get servers up.. (even though it's apparently been a priority for half a year.. hmph). Single player is great, multiplayer is fun but the wait has been disappointing and I can only hope they stay true to their game plan to implement dedicated servers before it's far too late for me and my friends.

Still, if you are looking for a good single player building experience it literally does NOT get any better than this.",Recommended,1002,508.0 hrs on record,Posted: May 30

This game is REALLY good. If you don't really get what is going on in this game, here's a quick explanation. You land down and begin to collect ores and other resources. Begin to get machines to automate it, and start focusing on power. Automate resources, to upgrade and find better resources. Keep going until the planet is your own little toy. As the name implies, this game is EXTREMELY satisfying and despite problems with power (Many problems) you come across late game, fixing them and looking over your industrial monster that YOU did all by YOURSELF feels very rewarding. You can also play with friends, yes it is early access at the time of writing so it should have been glitchy, but I actually got to Middlegame-ish without any bugs?

This is a bloody brilliant game.

Satisfactory feels like two titles merged into one.
In the first, you'll be creating the factory, which presents a series of growing challenges to your building and organizational skills, as you are tasked to set up complex production lines, made up by increasingly large machines that will require a vast amount of space and complex logistics.
Tech progress is made up of milestones, that you can unlock in the order you prefer (most of the time) by submitting specific products, and which in turn make you able to manufacture complex parts that will be required to unlock the next tier of technology. Such tiers bring about veritable revolutions in how your factory needs to work, and present whole new sets of challenges.

About this first aspect, as an avid player of building games like Fallout 4, Subnautica, Raft and Valheim, i must say Satisfactory may well have the best system i have ever worked with. The way things snap into place while still giving you flexibility and providing cues that facilitate orderly allignment, is near-perfect (yes i think i said pretty much the same thing about Valheim but Satisfactory is even better).
It's also deeply appreciable that can you replace things like conveyor belts with their improved counterparts without having to dismantle them first. You're going to have to built a LOT of conveyor belts.

In the second game, you'll be exploring the untamed wilderness (you start out by foot but can unlock a rather satisfying choice of vehicles and accessories like a jetpack), looking for resources and special items (some of which are still work in progress and not used but hey, can't hurt to stock up in advance) and defending yourself from aggressive fauna as you discover a world that is absolutely beautiful, often breathtakingly so, spanning from grasslands and forests that look like a mix of Pandora and Halo, to desert-like biomes, wetlands, swamps and volcanic valleys. Obtaining the special items will often require you to overcome a combination of challenges like reaching high places, surviving toxic gases, clearing boulders and beating particularly nasty encounters.

The map is truly vast and gave me a sense of wide-eyed exploration akin to that of Subnautica (but without the terror because technically it is you who are the threat to the world this time XD).
And finally, the soundtrack does it's job damn well, switching dynamically as you are either working in the factory or out in the field.

Satisfactory is definitely one of those games that i will keep installed forever, returning to it again and again. If you like building games you MUST have it.",Recommended,2241,190.8 hrs on record,Posted: May 30

My God this game is amazingly complex. I am only on Tier 3 of 8 tiers that I am aware of, and the complexity of what has to be engineered in game is off the charts for anything I've ever played. Imagine Subnautica on steroids when it comes to building and crafting your base/factory. The balance of survival with crafting and the beauty of the open world is on par with every other game of this genra. I HIGHLY recommend playing this game.

Just remember it is early access. The autosave feature protects you quite well from any bugs you experience, when is not really often, but they do happen. Mainly getting stuck.

My only recommendation at this time to the devs, is make it so you don't have to hold the mouse button down while working at the crafting bench. Maybe make it so you have to stand at it, but have an auto-craft option. I've been using my phone as a weight to hold the left mouse key down when trying to pump out 1000 screws.. lol.

One of the best open world survival-craft games that I have ever played. Your job is to scavange for resources and use those resources to make the parts required in order to unlock more blueprints to make better use of the resources available to you. But what makes this game different from other open world survival-craft games is that you can automate evrything. You can build machines with the blueprints that you unlock and let the machines do all the work for you so you can sit back and relax while draining the planet from its resources more efficiently. But the planet that you were sent to is not that safe. You must fight with some locals that are trying to protect the resources of their planet. Luckily you don't have to build walls or turrets because once you get rid of them they won't respawn and they don't damage buildings anyways because they are dumb. This game offers infinite possibilities with its large world and building mechanics. You can build whatever you want in this game. You can build tiny starter production lines or massive factories but you'll probably give up on trying to make your creations look good and end up building huge pile of spaghetties. You have to find creative ways to move the resources or the parts because resources are scattered all around the world. You can use conveyors, trains or even drones. Getting good at the game and finally building something decent will probably take a long time but once you get the taste of accomplishing something you will realize that it was all worth it.",Recommended,1288,80.2 hrs on record,Posted: May 29

Graphics:
•Arcade game
•bad
•meh
•good
•great ✅
•perfect
The graphics are great, especially up close (highest settings), I wish it was possible to set you view distance (distance at which the game renders grass, bushes etc) without having to type in a command on the console every time I log in

Music/Sound effects:
•bad
•meh
•good✅
•great
•stunning
The music is good but not amazing, I usually just turn on Spotify instead, the sound effects are only useful if your exploring because they can tell you if an enemy is approaching, otherwise they are a bit overwhelming.

Gameplay (walking moving interacting with things etc):
•bad
•meh
•good
•great
•perfect✅
Satisfactory’s gameplay is smooth, reliable and fun, everything just makes sense.
Playtime:
•2-4 hours
•10-15
•20-40
•40-60
•never ending ✅
While satisfactory DOES have a progression system, there is still so much to do once finishing it, gathering power slugs, finishing the research trees, getting all the hard drives and just building and optimizing stuff will add unlimited hours onto your world, and if you get bored, try the multiplayer or start a new world or get some mods!

Bugs/glitches:
•bad (everywhere)
•Meh (they’re there)✅(multiplayer)
•good (rare)
•great (almost never)✅(single player)
•perfect (never)

Seeing as satisfactory is in early access, CSS still has a ways to go before the bugs are exterminated. My friend came in my world and was apparently accosted several times with bugs, but I was able to go onto someone else’s world and have no bugs. I very rarely have issues in single player, when I do it’s usually due to conveyor belts or wacky hit boxes.

Pc specs:
•potato
•meh
•good✅
•great
•NASA
Satisfactory IS well optimized, but players with lower end PCs will be turning things down, which always sucks.

Price:
•only on sale
•overpriced
•perfect✅
•underpriced
30€ for more than 260 hrs and counting? Need I say more? Better than 60€ for Valhalla just to find out I need to fish for 30 hrs just to finish the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game (♥♥♥♥ u Ubisoft).

Final Verdict:
Satisfactory is a beautiful game with an amazing community (the discord is great) of both kidders and players. The Mod tool is super easy, just click the mods you want and restart the game (although some mods can cause crashes and other issues). It has bugs and the Epic-Steam multiplayer is terrible and takes forever to troubleshoot, if your getting it from recommendation of going to recommend it to a friend, make sure they get it on the same platform as you. The graphics are cool and impressive, the music and sound effects are good as well; There’s also a nice photomode that can be used while moving to helpfully allow you to zoom in. No payment required after buying the game and all updates are free, the devs clearly care a TON about the game and are pretty transparent with future updates, doing weekly update videos and engaging with the community.All around amazing game that I’m extremely glad to own.",Recommended,2528,361.4 hrs on record,Posted: May 29

Now you know that Josh made a pretty good representation of the game when he can make a conveyor belt cocoon to pretty much nowhere, be the leading exporter of nuclear waste and have the devs put it in their preview pictures.

So, Satisfactory. A few of my friends would sometimes call this Factorio 3D, but it really isn't. There are many mechanics in this game that differ from Factorio. You have hyper tubes to transport you between many areas, the buildings you need can be instantly built as long as you have the resources for it and conveyor belts can be on top of another conveyor belt. All of this really cool.

Now, if you think the map is procedurally generated, it isn't. When I learned that when I started several saves, I felt like it was a bit of a letdown. Maybe they plan to make ice or different worlds later after the early access game is complete?

The main goal of the game is to dig up resources and reach all of the milestones available in the game, all while delivering things to space with a giant space elevator. All for the sake of filling the ever necessary demands of the consumer.

The game is just fun. I have nothing bad to say about it, other than that I wish Other than that, great game. 9/10.",Recommended,1020,83.8 hrs on record,Posted: May 29

People call this a 3D Factorio, and they aren't entirely different. But Satisfactory does have many mechanics it outright changes, improves, or adds on to. Factorio is its own game as is Satisfactory.
Satisfactory is also constantly being developed with new stuff to add and has something Factorio doesn't, encouragement of exploration. I'm not the biggest big fan of exploration but it's there and it's nice to take a break sometimes.

This game is highly recommended. It’s quite challenging, especially in the beginning. Things I particularly appreciated are that the game world is beautiful, the game is generous to the player, not punishing, and the construction and tech tree make sense. Of course some suspension of disbelief is required, as when one pushes a button and a nuclear plant grows from a collection of steel beams and other parts.

The game is intellectually challenging as well as presenting challenging amounts of risk. At times I found my attention riveted to the play.

The game world is very detailed and cleverly worked out with a lavish amount of attention paid.
Though the game is classified as being in early access status, it shows a high degree of polish. If you’re interested, you should buy this game while it’s in early access, before the price goes up.

Satisfactory is one of those games where you say you'll play for ""Just an hour,"" play for a bit, then look up at the clock and realise you've been playing for 9 hours straight. That's not a bad thing if you keep that in mind before starting a session, because that time pays you back with the satisfaction of watching your well made factory manufacture highly complex parts from raw materials. Or, as with my playthroughs, start with a plan, then vastly underestimate your logistics requirements and watch as your beautiful factory spirals into a maze of conveyor belts and scaffolding. The game requires a lot of thinking and a bit of calculation to get things flowing smoothly, but that's the biggest part of the fun in my opinion.

On another note, the assets and gameplay elements that Coffee Stain adds always feel like they were tested properly and designed nicely well before their public release, which is pretty rare for an Early Access game. If the trailers or anything I've said here appeal to you, you'll probably enjoy this game.",Recommended,881,225.5 hrs on record,Posted: May 29

This game is one of the best games I have ever played. The buildings, belts, mechanics and everything are just awesome. The environment is mind blowing and beautiful. I just love this game, and it's worth playing.

But sadly I couldn't play this game after a while due to my systems spec, the more you expand the base, and try to build things through out the world, the more ram it consumes and sadly that's where I had to stop playing. I will surely play this game in future with a better system.

If you are going to buy this game, be prepared to have no plans as this will become your entire weekend. ""Oh, just one more milestone"" turns into full optimisation of your factory and a 1AM finish.

This game is 10x more fun with friends but also amazing on your own. The abuse of physics in multiplayer is great. The quiet grind by yourself is great. If you want to full nerd out, can I suggest drawing out the P&ID of your process on grid paper or perhaps writing a Python script to suggest minimum input for your required output.

It looks nice, it's well executed in many ways (and cheesy in a few others, but it's a beta), but at the very core, it's an idle game. There are, like in any idle game, a few superficial choices you can do to be more efficient, and it keeps you busy so you don't get bored in between the craftly intervalled drops of dopamine the game design is centered on delivering. Reward/unlock are spaced so that you can nearly access the next upgrade, just play 5 more minutes etc.

But can you lose? No you can't. Can you embrace a variety of approaches? Absolutely not. Just build, farm, build, farm, connect, connect, connect. It's not a game as much as it is a toy.

It's a reasonably cool toy though. You can chill building what is indeed a satisfying factory. Not a clever one, not a challenging one, but yours truly, and there's joy in that.

Still, the game take an awful lot of time to make you on the whole dumber. If you have any self estem, or don't fancy to be a dopamine junky, skip.",Not Recommended,822,53.3 hrs on record,Posted: May 29

OK, this is an amazing game. But it isn't something for me. My only reason is.... I don't have the time. I have only played for 2 hours but and it was a blast, and this is DEFINITELY a good game, and worth the purchase. But you preferably want to have a few hours spare per session because it takes a lot of time to build things, but it is - quite ironically - Satisfying.

So my verdict: Buy it if you are OK with spending a few if not several hours on this game at a time. But if you have only a short time, or are just a busy person, this probably isn't for you.

But this game is otherwise amazing, and a lot of fun!!!",Recommended,515,22.4 hrs on record,Posted: May 28

Indeed a satisfactory game.

Its like Factorio on steroid with first person camera. Maybe like Minecraft types with better graphics but with different approach, kind of sort of.

Anyone who is trying out this kind of genre for the first time, will definitely gonna have a wonderful impression. This game still is in early access but still runs better than some completed game out their, I've seen horrible. If you have friends who have same taste, definitely worth trying. It will not only occupy your thought but also will make you dream about it... nah just kidding.

But hey, its really fun to play, put your cognitive thinking skills, building strategy and management skill into test and it's result is really S A T I S F A C T O R Y. Watch your own creation grow into a massive scale conveyor belt maze where you dont even know what going on...LOL. It will get real messy if you are not organised enough and will turn into a conveyor belt mayhem!

This game receives lot of patches and updates getting optimised more and more.

It is a good game, but if feels like it is not really decided what it wants to be. The factory building thing is amazing, and that alone makes me recommend and enjoy this game. There are few non-game breaking bugs on that regard, and it is interesting to play different styles of factories and progress.
What bothered me is the other things about the game. I understand the main focus is the factory building, but this game tries to introduce a story, which is mostly irrelevant and while it does not adds to the game, it also doesnt subtract from it. This game introduces combat, which is also more or less irrelevant, and does not seem to take it anywhere.
While I think the factory building per se is good, other aspects of the game should be improved once they are introduced.",Recommended,658,13.6 hrs on record,Posted: May 27

76561198035804000,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198035804000/,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
This game has a long, LONG way to go.

-The UI is cumbersome due to the 1st person perspective. I get what they were going for, more of a real survival experience compared to Factorio's 3rd person perspective. But it is very time consuming and tedious to place/route conveyors cleanly.

-The 'buildings' just float in the air without the need for any support whatsoever. You can take the time to make it 'look right' but it doesn't actually matter. Places floors, build a factory, delete floors. Magical floating factory of magic. Yay, science.

-The assemblers take inputs on one side and outputs out the other, making assembly lines very bland and lacking in creativity. The robotic inserters of Factorio provide a much wider range of arrangement options between chains of assemblers which allows for a broader range of creativity and problem-solving for the players. These 'In on the left, out on the right' assemblers make building assembly lines a boring grind with little in the way of limiting factors beyond time/effort.

-It lacks a means to copy/paste groups of assemblers already built in tight, efficient layouts, forcing you to make additional copies manually, click by click.

-The tech is laid out poorly, unlocking things that would be very useful in the mid-game only in the late-game when they are no longer of any use to you.

-The late game just keeps scaling up the volume of items needed, but with a lacking mechanic to copy/paste groups of assemblers, it's just a grind to build more copies of each thing one at a time to meet the late-game demands.

-The vehicle transport systems to carry resources between outposts are pointless. Sure the vehicles transport items faster than a belt, but the truck stations only have ONE belt for input or output, so it is still bound by a 1-belt bottleneck. There is no difference between a truck route and simply a very long belt between outposts. This shows the devs are adding features 'because it would be cool' instead of a calculated functional niche it is to fill.

-The map is fixed, non-procedural and has massive holes to oblivion in it. There are waterfalls which rain down on to dry land. There are rivers/streams which are too shallow to be harvested as a water supply and thus completely pointless.

-The day/night cycle adds nothing to the game experience. Nothing is different between these two times. No predators come out at night, etc. Nothing changes. It's just dark, and you turn on your head lamp. The lamps/lighting you can build to combat the darkness in the factory is ... poorly done. Each light consumes ONE MEGAWATT of power. It's easy for the lighting to consume more power than the actual factory. Fortunately, they added a light switch to the game, but still... 1MW light bulbs? Really? Come on. Also these 1MW light bulbs illuminate very small areas, so you need a lot of them. And the game engine obviously has a hard limit on how many light sources it can render because you can see lights that are 'on' but not casting light until you get closer. It just looks bad.


This game has some good working features.

-It hasn't crashed or frozen on me yet.
-The multiplayer runs well with my friends.
-Performance is smooth even when streaming.
-No glaring memory leaks.
-The Hard Drives you can find through exploration allow you to unlock alternative recipes for various components, allowing for a unique combination of recipes, and thus a unique play-through factory design experience, each time you play. That's a really good idea.
-The 'company store' as a means to buy/unlock various equipment upgrades is also a good mechanic, allowing you to unlock just the tools you need/want and providing smaller-scale achievements/goals beyond the longer-term goals of unlocking the next tier.


All-in-all, I do not enjoy this game. The beginning is fun, as the effort versus reward is well balanced. But as the game progresses and resource logistics and demand scale up, but I still have to build everything one click at a time without the ability to copy/paste or blueprint layouts, the effort goes up exponentially while the reward does not. Then it is many hours, or even days, of grind to unlock one more step forward. Not worth it. The game has potential, but in its current state, it is a FAR inferior knock-off of Factorio or FortressCraft. Far inferior.

Don't buy it yet. Make the devs earn the paycheck by actually finishing the game.",Not Recommended,3712,111.8 hrs on record,Posted: May 27

I LOVE IT! I'm vary open minded but not that easy to impress. But this game delivers for sure. The vary moment you spawn in it feels like an adventure. YOUR adventure. You decide how you want to play the game witch makes it your own mission. You just can't stop while your at it. The graphics and the environment is truly amazing and the over all experience (sound/effects/animations/handling/details/physics/amount of gadgets/the feeling when you reached the goal you set) is great! The game is easy and hard at the same time. If you forget things it's all on you. Poor planing will hit you in the face. What's your goal? Efficiency? Mass production? Design? Practical? Why not all in one? The feeling when you use to run... but now you drive B) The feeling when you use to collect leaves and sticks for fuel but now you've made machines that generate all energy for you B) It's rewarding. It's good exercise for your brain... and with some creativity there's no limit to your masterpiece. It's 5/5 from Sandwich and that's rare stuff coming from me.

Outstanding world design, exploration, and very satisfying logistics combine to make this game a wonderful way to spend time. The game is still early access, but there's an astounding amount of content and more great stuff arrives with every new update. There is, as yet, no story, so if building a factory for the sake of building a factory won't motivate you, you might be better off to wishlist this and check back later. If you're happy to be self-guided, though, it's a wonderful world to explore, and automation is a great solution to the problem of grind in open world games.

Pros:

Beautiful, gigantic, handcrafted map.
Satisfying, detailed 3D factory design.
Fun with trains, drones and jetpacks and possibly even friends.

If you like factory simulation with a splash of exploration and bit of fighting then this game is for you.

Pros

There might be a few ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ but nothing in anyway game breaking. Overall works much better than a lot of the games I own.
Alien world location.
You can build you factory without much thought or you can do in depth planning exercise and build for maximum efficiency.
Good progression system.
Good graphics.
Regular updates.

A great game, however a few problems. Lets start with the positives though!

The logistics through the game are pretty easy. They ramp up eventually, but the game makes it easy to ramp up products and get you engaged in trying to make things as ratio'd up as possible. Brilliant tools to use, such as zip line (which I know is a new addition), blade runners, re-bar gun and a host of other things really makes you think about what you need to carry and use to do each part of the job well.

The game is only around 40% logistics though, to begin with. The map is beautiful, and very atmospheric. Danger feels like it is around the corner all the time, but then you also feel free to jump and explore all the time. So much vegetation is abundant in each area making it feel alive.

Multiplayer is fun. Go off, explore each going their own way, with their own projects, all to make the final product faster and more rich. A dedicated explorer and a dedicated builder ensures a massive collection radius of resources, locating ore points and scouting for new building areas, whilst the builder ensures the explorer has a home to come back to.

The 3D aspects of building, although looking daunting from the outset, is actually made very easy and simple with a huge range for building objects. The models and textures for the game are also very rich, and brings the factory to life.

With all this positivity I have to start with some bad parts. There is only one map, and this on its own is not bad. It is a great map, very large, lots to explore. Hand crafted. But this is where it falls down. If it was procedurally generated I could happily give a pass, but its hand crafted.
So why, oh why, do we have floating grass? We have elongated textures in some harder to reach but still easily accessible places where the cliff face should be cliff, but its clear its an elongated grass structure. We have hidden power slugs still underneath terrain. Two resource nodes too close to each other to use both at the same time (that I've come across, possibly more!). This is a hand crafted map. It should receive more love over the 2 years then it has.

Also where are the extra maps? 2 years, no extra maps? Or teasing for extra maps? Or DLC maps? Nothing? I'm happy to give them a pass on this one, under the guise that they want to make sure that everything else in the game is polished before they add more maps so that everything on a new map can be balanced. But I've had the game for less then 100 hours and I feel like I've seen everything on this map now... I feel ready for a change.

AI mapping and attack sequences still appear to be missing in some areas. One enemy type literally just 'floats' about, no animations what-so-ever. I'd be happy to say it was just me, but I've seen it on a friends machine too. 2 years to add some animations to an enemy? Because this enemy has been in the game since launch too. AI tends to stick to zones which is fine, pretty standard in most games... But I've also seen the enemy run directly away from me outside of their supposed zone to... ???

The prices of the logistics ramp up very quickly. It can go from needing a couple of iron spots to needing at least 20 to keep the later mechanics going at a pace. Spent a long time just setting up the expansion of industry which is pretty much copy-paste other areas I've already built. Doesn't sound too bad, apart from there is no copy-paste function or blueprint function that I've found in game. Quite happy to say we can only copy stuff on foundations etc etc or any limitations, but if you have a factory game Factorio set the standard, and that standard now includes copy-paste...
In the past I'd have happily spammed the left click for foundations, but now that should be base game to easily expand areas rather then rely on mods to fill these spots. This goes for a lot of the little problems with building, ""Oh there is a mod for that"" should not be a go-to response.

Models are... Boring? They all do the same thing, again and again and again. For the smelters this is okay, we are smelting ore. Ore goes in, ingots come out. There is no animation. But you've provided one on most of the other machines, and these animations should respect the recipes set. The production of a rotor should get a different animation over reinforced plate, and so on and again. This will really cement the idea that your factory is alive and allow you to see from a glance what the machine is actually doing.
The last issue I have with models is clipping. You don't allow clipping through other models but terrain is fine? Wires dangling through foundations? There is little consistency here that needs tightening up, don't allow clipping through terrain (either by just don't let us or add extra supports) or allow us to clip through everything.

This leads onto trains. Now spamming signals everywhere seems like a bad idea in this game, however you could program the rails to add them in dynamically or something. But to have no clipping trains? They feel very cheaty.
This then leads onto a lack of a logic system. Okay this is a stretch of a lead, but if a train isn't full of a product I would rather it didn't leave a station. And this starts to lead onto a lot of the other industries. I can't store only a little bit of product, its a full cargo container or nothing. Automated power systems are not a thing, I.E. Power is dipping under a certain point, please stop supplying the grid until you've recovered your own personal area of power. Okay, we can separate grids and I would honestly suggest to any players to place their coal miners and water extractors on a separate grid, but can we not logic that? Well no, because that system isn't in the game...

And lastly multiplayer. I already know they have said they are still working on the code. But when you load into a world and I can not see what products are on a belt it makes me feel like the factory has died, and took me a while to realise that the items were just not visually loading in for me.

It is a good game. But I would love to see just a little more effort on what is in the game at the moment over adding more mechanics for mechanics sake.",Recommended,5083,194.9 hrs on record,Posted: May 26

Very chilling game with very fun construction and logical depenndencies that force you to cosntantly update your factory design.

Many interesting building as well as Satisfactory (lol) progression of multiple tiers and sub-tiers.

There is also beautiful landscape which if fun for exploration as well as some light combat elements (basically the combat is only started on your initiative, because you can easily run away from combat if you don't want to fight).

Last, but not least, this is the first game which made me regret cutting down entire forest to make space for my factory.",Recommended,512,84.5 hrs on record,Posted: May 26

As of this writing it's still a little rough around the edges, but if you want a beautiful, humorous, somewhat less complex and less combat/defense oriented take on Factorio or Minecraft tech mods, this is it.

To be clear it's plenty complex enough, and if you've done something like Technic mod pack in Minecraft it'll feel very familiar, down to many of the basic game mechanics, technology tiers, and resources. It's just not quite as deep as Factorio, which is not necessarily a bad thing! Satisfactory is more approachable and lower pressure overall, while still leaving plenty of room to obsessively optimize and build ridiculously massive factories.

If you're looking for combat, look elsewhere. At the moment it seems tacked on and shallow. Monsters do not attack (and cannot damage) your base, and mostly serve as occasional annoyances while you're trying to build your rural infrastructure or as trivial obstacles to resources. Fighting them is clunky - you're hilariously ill-equipped for it, but on the other hand their AI is basic AF so once you figure out their patterns it's easy enough to deal with them. If it weren't for the fact that they drop a few items you need in small quantities, I'd rather they didn't exist.",Recommended,1049,81.1 hrs on record,Posted: May 26

Satisfactory vs Factorio

The chances are that if you've found yourself looking at Satisfactory, you also know about Factorio. Being a Factorio player, I was intrigued by Satisfactory because as good as the former is, you soon find yourself wanting to do things like build multi-level conveyor systems, which leads onto thoughts of a 3D automation game.

So here we are, 3D Factorio right? Well, no. Satisfactory is a bit of a slow starter; the initial premise is the same - you've arrived on an alien world with little more than a toolbelt and a bit of knowledge. You're going to need to collect raw resources with your bare hands, and assemble them into something useful. At this point, Factorio isn't fully committed to trying to kill you - whereas Satisfactory will start to try and do that pretty much straight away (depending where on the map you go). Fortunately you have a handy stick and once you understand how they work, the initial enemies are reasonably straightforward to dispatch. It's worth mentioning here that where Factorio provides you a random world, Satisfactory's is very much hand crafted - it might lower replayability in the long run, but it looks great and offers some early challenge moving around (and remembering where you came from).

Shortly after finding your feet, you'll be directed to, or will have managed to build an iron miner, a smelter, and a belt between the two. This is much the same in both games, automation at last! Obviously not forgetting that you need to hook machines up to power poles, and your early power stations - biomass burners, need feeding with leaves and wood collected by hand.

This is where the games start to diverge again; in that now, you're quite comfortable with the enemies you're fighting in Satisfactory and you've largely worked out that they protect certain areas, and don't come and attack you or your factory. In the other game, you might have started having to repel your first waves of the bitey things which will keep coming and keep destroying your stuff.

It's at this point where Factorio ramps up the complexity; lots of machines required to build lots of components, to go into machines and ever refine into more specialist components - Satisfactory follows the same path but more gently, the production chains aren't that long or complex - at first it will be a simple transformation of one part to another (ore->ingots) and then onto machines than can combine two, then three, and four comes near the end of the research tree. It's not trying to kill you constantly (to the point where you can leave the game running and know you're safe), and so you can enjoy it as a rather relaxing (and very pretty) factory building game. There's always stuff to do, but much of it is making things look nice, tweaking them for efficiency, refueling your power set up, and leveling up by sending your components back through the space elevator you've by now built. You'll enjoy building factories on top of factories if you so want, whether you have a single large building or lots of little focussed installations at various places is up to you. Your ore miners never 'run out' in Satisfactory, so whether things work or they don't, are currently powered or not, makes little difference as long as you can go and get the things out of them that you need.

I like my games complex a lot of the time (never needlessly so) and hence made the comparison between what is on paper, two very similar games. What I have found though, is that whilst I will go back to Factorio and try to further that game - I've really enjoyed a quite, well, satisfying experience with this game.

I think I'm near the end of Satisfactory; and I think it's near the end of it's development cycle. What remains to be seen is whether it's replayable in its current state (and whether I'd want to), or what the developers add in the finished game to make you want to go through it all again and again.

That said, in one playthrough I have more than had my money's worth and so heartily recommend this to anyone.

TL;DR:
- Satisfactory is 3D and allows you to build upwards and outwards and enhance your spaghetti mess like never before. It looks lovely and runs well.
- Satisfactory tries to kill you early on; but overall is far less threatening than Factorio which will kill you and destroy your factory.
- If you die in Satisfactory, you respawn and go to loot your stuff. In Factorio, you die and have to reload a save or start again.
- In satisfactory, your automation setup feels less complex than Factorio. There's precious little filtering (but some) and lines that effectively handle multiple products (you can split and merge but 'smart splitting' is fairly advanced in an optional research tree). And there's plenty of room not to cram everything into a small space anyway.
- Factorio has lots of logic stuff going on and really programmable machines, I have seen no evidence of that in Satisfactory. It's not a bad thing, just different. This is less hardcore.
- The two games are different enough that if you like the genre, you might like both and it's worth owning both. They may compete in the same space but they also compliment each other, with sufficient differences in how they play out.",Recommended,4365,90.5 hrs on record,Posted: May 26

This one's still got a fair bit of work that needs to be done on it, but the devs seem to be working hard to make it nice.

I cannot believe that I have played Satisfactory for over 1,000 hours. If you have ADHD or OCD then you may find yourself addicted to this game just like me. For example, you can place your buildings almost where ever you like. But then OCD hits and forces you to dismantle them and place them in a row with all conveyor belts turning at 90 degree angles and you need lights to show off how good of an architect you truly are and then create majestic, massive coal power plants. WHY?!? Because that's the only way it looks correct....That's why. And why is it when I hear that power outage sound it hurts so much it makes my ears bleed?!?

And to everyone that uses the arachnophobia option...You are the reason why I'm now terrified of kittens!!!

But I do have to drop a thank you to the modding community. You all rock!!! You have provided me with countless extra hours of fun and frustration.

Great game.

It was super-addictive for the first 12 hours that I played in a single stretch. I finally went to bed after building my first coal power plant. After that it gets a bit more difficult. Still trying to figure out how people get resources and materials all the way across the map to various resource nodes with trees and junk in the way. Having finally begun refining oil and having a rifle, blade runners and jetpack certainly helps.

I got this game because I loved Tropico 4 and was disappointed in 5 and, even more so, 6. I wanted to be able to manage factories. While this game is completely different, it's still amazing.

The graphics alone are incredibly great, especially considering how well it runs on my laptop (as long as I have an external fan plugged in).

Also, the community is freaking great.

You like exploring? You enjoy building stuff? (bridges, plateau's, buildings, any stuff your imagination allows you to build)
Happy to use vehicles, play explosive catch with evolved heavy carapace boars? Hop from a high altitude rock to another with your jetpac or drop to your death being replaced by an exact copy of yourself. Neat!

My god this game is exactly what you need.

Everyone will play Satisfactory differently. You could be building a massive Nuclear setup or focus primarily on your job as a Ficsit Pioneer by completing (when it is finally done) for project Assembly. (the food court high up in the sky)

But if you like building, exploring, some fighting, lots of thinking and calculating and changing then you can spent a lot of time in this game. As I play this game with my wife, multiplayer does still have some bugs (early access) but it makes the game a lot more interacting playing together. And a lot easier as doing things with multiple people simply makes it more efficient.

All in all, the game is so much fun and as I have not played factorio I did not have anything comparable.",Recommended,938,680.0 hrs on record,Posted: May 25

Factory games are a new genre for me. I started with Dyson Sphere which completely hooked me and then gave this a try and well, I don't remember what the outside looks like anymore. Seriously, game is crack level addicting. Its kind of like Subnautica only less story and more problem solving. Truly, insanely deep game

Pros:
- If you were thinking about getting divorced this game will probably make it happen
- i am like 100 hours in and pretty sure i am just scratching the surface
- world is beautiful
- this type of game from a first person perspective is something i never thought would work but it does
- world feels totally immersive
- The world is huge... or at least seems huge.

Cons
- building verticaly (which is encouraged) can sometimes be frustrating because there are a lack of affordances lining things up. Trying to install a vertical conveyor from the ground that needs to go up 3 or 4 levels can take several tries.
- because of what I mention above it sometimes the game is fighting you to build things. Things not lining up, things not being copied in the same direction or with the same recipe and small annoyances like that sometimes rage me. But i realize its early access
- it will consume massive amounts of your free time. Seriously, you will say I am going to sit and play for an hour and you look at the clock and its 4am.

TheSacredVoice,https://steamcommunity.com/id/TheSacredVoice/,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
I scoffed when I saw reviews claiming that ""Satisfactory was always on their mind and they spent their days consumed with thoughts of the next phase of their factory's construction."" I dismissed these views as the deranged ravings of rabid fans, the like of which you only find lurking on fanatical subreddits.

I don't know when they started. The voices, I mean. Now when I get into bed I hear them all competing: ""what're we going to do with the heavy residual oil?"" ""We should expand the coal power plant, the current output isn't fit for purpose."" ""The belt capacity alone won't support more factories!"" ""When are we going to connect the secondary sites with transport tubes?"" ""With a throughput of 200 screws a minute we'll barely be achieving an output of 8 rotors!""

Now I go to sleep thinking about it. I think about the next project; I think about laying the foundations; I think about the splits required; I think about the input quantities and byproduct mitigation. I think about the areas I still need to explore; the beacons I need to collect; the components my factory hasn't automated yet.

And, after the thoughts stop, I dream about it. I dream of the resources moving along the conveyors. I dream of the recipes and the options. I dream of the travel tubes I'm going to put down. I honestly wish this hadn't happened, but it has.

But how can I not dream about it? When you look back at your factories, no matter how messy or spaghetti-reliant, they still look marvellous. You'll walk amongst the chimney spires belching smoke, ride the conveyors with the inputs, gaze at the increasingly intricate production lines. After the dust has settled and the uranium rods come rolling out for the first time, you won't be able to help but think ""I am a god and all will marvel at my work.""

Here's the thing about Satisfactory, what passes for combat and enemy AI is anything but. There's always a group of enemies guarding every node (at least the five or so that I found in the admittedly tiny amount of time I could put up with this game) you have only a taser with a nonexistent range to fight them with (I was standing in front of one of these enemies who couldn't enter the room portion of the tier 3 HUB and couldn't hit them but they could hit me, it was directly in front of me and I had to basically walk into the character model in order to land a hit) so you die basically every time one of these things aggros on you.

They also chase you ENDLESSLY, you have to die to get them to stop at which point they return to their original spawn point, which is on top of a resource node, effectively making that node useless unless you want to dig up as much as you can before you die then try and retrieve it from your corpse and run out of the aggro range before the enemy kills you again. The combat and enemy AI which is basically just endlessly chasing and attacking anything that enters aggro range, is completely unbearable and makes the fun stuff impossible to enjoy, purchase refunded. Maybe I'll try again if I ever hear that they fixed this. No I'm not interested in a peaceful mode, I'm interested in enemies that I can actually fight off or at least run away from.

I found an absolute ton of complaints about this from over a year ago in the official forums when I searched for a way around this problem, but yeah, over a year ago. Doesn't give me much hope. I'm honestly really surprised this game is rated in the top 50 steam games. I was able to get to the point where I was running my own faction and massive outpost in Kenshi, have over 500 hours in Rimworld and this game was too much frustration for me.",Not Recommended,1507,0.4 hrs on record,Posted: May 24

Excellent fun to build/rip down/ build again for the sake of beauty and efficiency. Graphics are stunning and for a full-time working adult with a family it has enjoyable time management (play when you can and next time start off where you left). I haven't even explored too far away from the base yet (but now I am forced to to find crude oil :) ). I would have never thought to have so much fun with a non-combative strategy game (loved Civ series and C&C, Starcraft, etc.).

-I have always enjoyed these types of games. Making larger and larger factories to create more and more products to sell in order to get stuff that allows you to create larger factories. But as fleshed out as this seems and as good as it looks, I'll be looking for another game. There is only one reason for that... the power system.
-I got all the way up to coal power which helps A LOT. The system before then is so horrible. It required me to constantly micromanage my generators by deforesting everything the eye can see, then crafting the leaves and wood into biofuel and running around, filling generators every 30 minutes.
-With that said coal still has it's problems, no matter how hard I try there is no good way to organize cables or coal generators. It is always a mess.
-It's hard to put into words why I dislike the system so much. All I can say is I spent about an hour organizing a new setup and I was excited to see how well it worked. But then I was stuck messing with the power for another 2 hours.

I wish there was a way to turn off the power requirement system entirely in a world.
There are other similar games that just give you the satisfaction of organizing a factory without this system .

Or here is another fix. Allow me to connect coal generators to 1 pole allowing for everything connected to that pole to be 150 max watts instead of 75. But allow it to work with infinite amount of generators.",Not Recommended,1181,12.5 hrs on record,Posted: May 23

Fun game about extracting resources from nodes and using different buildings to convert those resources into other resources that are then converted in other buildings which are then put into a resource sink to get tickets so you can buy stuff. All while trying to figure out how much of each resource you need and how to connect everything, while maintaining enough power for the buildings to consume and keep working.
There's also exploration, the map is hand made and quite nice. There are also things hidden across the map to find that will help boost your factory's productivity (power slugs, crash sites).

I've never played a factory game before, thought I would give it a try. I reckon I have put about 50 hours into it in the last 7 days. Its just amazing. And this is only me playing solo, I cant wait until my mates get it.
There is always something to do, the factory must grow and needs power. The quest for new tech is insatiable. The organisation you put into it, the rejigging of conveyor belts. everything is gold.
Just get it and you wont be disappointed.
The downside is I dont want to do anything else ever so....also buyer beware I guess?

There are many ways to play this game. I started off trying to be 'efficient' and 'quick'. This got tiresome for me, but there's a lot of depth there given some of the math and the algorithm challenge of setting up efficient - and in some cases, super complicated - factory lines.

Then I went whole hog art project, and have really enjoyed the creative limitations as far as what you can and can't do and how to work around those limitations.

I don't usually do reviews, but this game absolutely blew my mind so hard.

to all potential buyers: be warned, this game will consume your mind, you will find yourself constantly thinking about optimizing your layout, re-designing factories, floors, conveyor systems, ways to transport items.

Just when you thought you created the most good looking, efficient factory you will ALWAYS find that one production bottleneck and it will force you to completely start over from scratch.

My experience with this game has been, for the most part, quite good. There were some frustrations that came from the learning curve, but nothing too drastic or overwhelming. Figuring out how to maximize and manage your processes can be quite fun and engaging. Plus, the inherent adventure of exploring the world and handling its challenges was immense fun.
However, this comes to a screeching halt with the final challenge of the game. The complexity and magnitude of the requirements for it spikes to levels beyond ridiculous. If I have to sit down with a XL spreadsheet and a calculator while not even playing the game just to figure out how many DAYS of letting the game run by itself 24-7 under optimal conditions to accomplish the FIRST of four final goals... it all turns into a mountain of ""I don't want to do ANY of this"".

Perfect game. There are not many games that are this addictive, while making you build towards something great and visible in the process. This is the good kind of engaging game; unlike other games that use cheap tactics to keep you addicted. This really taps into you craving for intellectual challenge. And you'll be proud of your results after every session. There is always room for improving your production lines, and that will keep you coming back for another session of flow and focus... all this, while having a relaxing experience of concentration.",Recommended,484,336.3 hrs on record,Posted: May 20

Solid functionality while in Early Access. The base game runs well in Single Player. Multiplayer still a little glitchy.

On Launch, I'll be waiting for:

Fully fleshed out story / environment: Coffee Stain has used lots of placeholder things that have promise.

Replayability: Once you've made a factory that does ""all the things,"" it's hard to imagine why you'd load the game back up. The game needs some valid reason for zeroing out the research and buildings to start all the way back at Square One, or a reason to keep engaging with a complete factory.

Right now, I can recommend this Early Access title. Even if there was that thing with E.G.

We'll have to see after launch if that changes.",Recommended,600,141.1 hrs on record,Posted: May 20

What can I say that hasn't been said about this game already...

You know, I'll say this, then. The game is fantastic. It really does steal your time. What I enjoy most, is that once you set your factory up perfectly, you can simply let it do it's thing, while you go out and explore the map. Since the 4 starting areas are just points to begin on the grander scale of the big map (32km^2), wherever you start, you'll be able to access the entirety of the map. So you can explore, gather up hard drives from crashed pods, or power slugs to overclock your machines.

And the machines really are the heart and soul of the game. They are so well animated, and the rush of getting everything to line up perfectly with 100% efficiency is one I never expected to love.

Clock speeds of machines is something that seems simple at first, but you realize that you can also manipulate power requirements of machines using it, to keep your power grid from getting overwhelmed.

Overall, I did not expect to love this game as much as I did. I bought it on Epic Games Store before it came to Steam, and bought it again once it hit Steam, since this was the only real reason I used Epic Games anyways. Definitely worth buying.",Recommended,1009,97.0 hrs on record,Posted: May 20

This game is by far the most visually appealing factory/logistics/automation game I have played. I love the dash of combat, and the exploration. The world is truly beautiful. Coffee Stain did a great job with this game. Even in Early Access, my experiences have been smooth, non-buggy hours of fun. With 95 total hours played, I need to bump my numbers up, but I am really enjoying the various aspects of this game.

I really like the in-game store concept that is implemented. By having a conveyor belt system discard your waste, you earn tickets and you can redeem them for additional cosmetic pieces, vice paying real $$$ for the cosmetics. You will need those pieces, because the world is massive and you can pretty much build anywhere, and your factories can be as large and spread out, or as condensed as you want them to be.

So the beginning of the game is pretty straight forward

Process item A to turn it into item B

Then eventually Combine item X and item Y and Get Z

However to do this on a sufficient scale you have to create factories, multiple buildings processing items in parallel.

The problem is that in the second half of the game things have to be processed in a crazy number of stages in varying proportions, that is not taking into account alternate recipe’s that, while simplifying the process, alter the proportions required. The game needs specifically on the higher tiers to make it easier to plan these long chains of stages to get to your desired items. You can try tools like https://satisfactory-calculator.com/ or https://u4.satisfactorytools.com/ to try and plan out the factory, but there is no guarantee these tools are up-to-date.

As of Update 4

It’s enjoyable to a significant extent, there is a lot of potential and it seems they are rounding their late game setup, but if you are going to make it this in depth at the end you need something to help you plan.",Recommended,907,388.7 hrs on record,Posted: May 19

For ""Early Access"" it doesn't really have that Beta Vibe. The game is flushed out.

The progression route is a little strange, utilising materials and optimisation to unlock the next tier of items. But that's also what I love about the game. Its a chill material grind game whereby you create machines to do the hard work. Then the tougher steps involve more materials which require more machines. The only trouble is with this method of grind, is that you must constantly need to rethink your base which can be aggravating at times.",Recommended,460,194.3 hrs on record,Posted: May 19

(TBH - It has less bugs than most of the recent full release games...I won't call them out. We know which games I'm talking about) The worst bug I had encountered while playing was I got stuck when standing next to a tree, but that was fixed by simply crouching.

alot of down reviews say that the game is too boring and repitive and it is basically just doing the same thing over and over again but if you are gonna look it at that way than that is basically every game: just doing the same thing over again. But there is really more to it, you are able to design your own machines to make it as efficient as possible and there are alot of fun challanges to face and you unlock alot of new things the further you progress. The only negative things I have to say about this game is that it takes alot of time and energy it can be overhelming to think about what you still need to do but once you have finished something big it's amazing to look back at how far you have come. So trust me just keep on moving forward and it will be all worth it in the end.

You can tell most of the game's polish is focused around its factory mechanics - which makes sense and is where the game truly shines. However, its exploration and combat mechanics, despite having a lot of potential, currently leave much to be desired. Haven't played multiplayer so I don't know how stable it is and something to keep in mind. Overall, if you're looking for a first-person Factorio-esque experience this game has enough substance to fulfill that.

Title : You want us to build here?

Graphics : *****
Gameplay : *****
U.I. : ****
GameMech : ****
Co-Play : Yes

(@) Early-Access, Update 4, 250+ hours playing at this point

(@) Overall:
Started just before Update 4 - with the drones and power revamp. If you loved Factorio, Love the old Minecraft Factory mods, you should enjoy this game as well. Still in early access, some quality of life improvements still need to be made.. Has some combat threats that can be handled with either pure physical responses or even planned ranged death. The belt connecting system is good, the transport system has many options to play with. Vehicles can be used to transport or explore the world.

(@) Pro:
The game has a good vibe for exploration and a wide expanse of a world. Plenty of places to go and see, different biomes to review and explore. I like to build with my friends, co-op is one of my big attractions.

(@) Cons:
Not being able to line your factory up very easily in the beginning. Some multiplayer bugs at this time cause strange things to happen, like out-of sync errors. I am hoping a quality of life update will fix these. No dedicated server option - that I know of, this would be great to run in the background.",Recommended,1029,340.6 hrs on record,Posted: May 17
wizcreations,https://steamcommunity.com/id/wizcreations/,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
TLDR: Missing mid-game quality of life features, thus forcing players to slowly do the same thing over and over again.

The first 20 hours are amazing. Having played hundreds of hours of Factorio in the few years leading up to Satisfactory's release, I had this one on my wishlist for a while as a possible 3D Factorio alternative. Now that I've played it, I can say this is way more than a mere 3D Factorio. This is an entirely different game and new experience. Added bonus: this game has stellar detail, graphics, and animations

I love how Satisfactory encourages the steady buildup of a factory. The tech tier unlocks usually transition you smoothly to an ever expanding factory in which you can go back to upgrade miners, double production, use faster belts, add more constructor machines, and expand into the distance for even more resources. It is also easy to get a perfect balance between miners and machines, and upgrading throughput is a simple matter of upgrading and/or overclocking a miner, then using the new raw ore to do whatever you need. This game provides a steady growth and expansion without ever feeling overwhelming. The game walks you through each new unlock by forcing you to build it before you can unlock the next tier. You can't simply research everything and then find yourself overwhelmed and unable to build. I never ran into a ""what do I do next"" confusion.

Instead, what I did run into was a mid-game terribly lacking every quality of life feature to make it worth playing. As I increased my ability to harvest resources, I also needed to increase the number of machines processing those resources. This involved an incessant rebuilding of the same layout over and over and over and over without end. Also missing is the ability to duplicate vehicle automation to have two or more vehicles perform the same function.

I don't see myself ever finishing the game unless this monotony is removed by fixing:
- Lack of blueprints drives repeatedly building the same setup over and over and over.
- Lack of map to show what obstacles may be in your way to get to that node that is 1800m away.
- Forced to spread far and wide to find all resources, but lack of fast travel options to quickly get around to your different outposts.
- Not everything can snap in place, making alignment sometimes difficult.",Not Recommended,1954,45.0 hrs on record,Posted: May 17

If you know you're gonna like this game, you know you're gonna like this game.

The title is an already apt description for the entire experience. After spending actual brain power figuring out how an efficient assembly is supposed to run, and then translating it into an aesthetically pleasing monolith of a factory, the levels of pure satisfaction you're able to achieve are only limited by your imagination and the raw resources given to you.
All in all it's a far more complete experience than I was expecting, even for an early access title, and if you're even remotely interested in any of the main mechanics on the back of the box, you won't regret picking this one up.",Recommended,578,74.3 hrs on record,Posted: May 17

I was looking for a quality timesink in 2020, and here in 2021 it's looking like i'm still gonna need one. This is easily one of if not the best management and development experiences i have had in a video game. It's not very hard on your wallet, and the content goes pretty darn far considering the Developers still intend to add more to the game. I was kind of expecting to have some issues, but there are no real deadlines imposed by the game itself so it really isn't overwhelming as long as you manage things properly. Nothing makes me happier than coming up with a plan, putting in the work, and finally seeing things to completion with good results.

Este jogo está muito bom, com excelentes gráficos e uma boa optimização. Um bom exemplo disso é o facto de estar a jogar com uma GTX 1050 2GB e um ryzen 3 1300x e conseguir jogar no ultra a 1080p com um framerate até bom (passou dos 30fps para mim é vitória eu não sou muito exigente).
Tenho me divertido bastante com o jogo e ver as minhas máquinas a trabalhar de forma eficiente é muito satisfatório e de vez em quando frustrante pois tem vezes que o meu quarto fica cheio de fumo de quanto eu queimo o cérebro para por certas coisas a funcionar.

Satisfactory started of to me as ""Factorio in 3D"" and ended up being the game I enjoyed playing the most out of any game so far.
Graphics are fantastic, exploring while your base is doing its thing creating passive progress is rewarding, and of course, building is very satisfactory. It is a game you can really lose yourself in, especially when you get to the late game recipes and trying to optimize your factory. Fantastic game for anyone who wants to work after work!

There is STILL is no clear objective for this game they just keep adding more redundant building material to keep building more redundant building material for bigger buildings that build more crap without putting it into something.

This game is literally the exact opposite of the ""satisfaction"" I get from an actual game like Factorio. For a game that relies on 3 dimensions, you would think of the multiple more layers of accessibility in both features and form in comparison to a simplistic 2d factory game like factorio. But alas, it does not.

I've played this game for a total of 100 minutes, and every minute was a seething mess of emotions. The fact that a game with an extra dimension doesn't have something as simplistic as an alignment tool for god sake. Everything you do ends up being an unaligned mess for no reason what so ever. The devs took the time to add an alignment tool to BUILDINGS but nothing else. Why on earth is there a limitation for a basic principle of functionality.

The game has awful collision, so I'm assuming they didn't play test the few first starter items you get to play with at the beginning of the game, considering this was a half arsed mess on release that barely featured anything. The first thing I attempted to do was to jump on top of the player base, only to fall through said base just... because? It's literally THE first item you build and half of it doesn't have collision. Nor does any of the random crashed ships, and nor does have the conveyor belts, as the first thing I did was accidentally place an electric pole through a conveyor belt. And of course, you can just place down electric poles as you please without any consideration of buildings, with the same kind of connection system as Factorio but without the ease of use features such as ""Hold down the mouse and drag to automatically place the damn things down"". Instead, you have to manually place the pole along the long ass line of conveyor belts you just placed, go back to where you started, and connect each pole INDIVIDUALLY. After 5 years of development your first thought to one of the BASIC features of your game wasn't to make a simple drag system?

The game is a pretty blatant rip off of factorio, even things as simple as crafting speeds and amounts of items you get from crafting things. It's the same basic functionality but even more jank because good luck looking for something as simple as an ore vein, because they are literally impossible to find and you WILL end up spending 20 minutes looking around for them. What the hell are you thinking to not include a simple piece of equipment you can build to help you find ore veins at the beginning of the game, surely if you're to copy something like a game such as Factorio you would consider... I don't know, the extra dimension? Especially when it's a selling point for god sake.

I have no idea why the crafting bench OR the armour bench exist other than to fulfil the purpose of what your inventory crafting should do in most other games, but the difference is that for some reason you can spawn these massive buildings out of the blue, but not a portable miner. Portable is IN the name, I get it's an item, but the fact you have to actively keep messing around going back to these massive work benches for the same thing your inventory can fulfil, then why have the extra step inwhich the massive factory you have generate and sprawl out isn't treated the same way, when I can just use a regular miner. It's annoying and isn't intuitive. Don't make the workstation an entity you can just literally click on, make separate tables and enforce a reason to actively have these different stations, other than just having two for two different arbitrary reasons.

Scrap the factorio comparisons. Minecraft Feed the Beast is a mod pack made by generally anyone who feels like making a mod, on a engine running on Java of all things, in their own time, not IN a studio and developed by ACTUAL game developers. And I will be far enjoy and love playing that more than I enjoy playing this, simply because it isn't a clone, it isn't jank and lazy game design. And, most importantly, it doesn't have the most rail-road factory building systems that rely on the most bog standard tier systems known to man.

The conclusion of my experience is this; this is a lazy, half arsed rip off of a clearly superior game, maybe not in overall features, but DEFINITELY in play-ability and ease of playing the damn game. 100 minutes and the only thing I've learned that this is a over-remembered mess of a game that constantly trips over itself because the devs don't check their own spelling mistakes in their exam. It's a joke. Go back to the basic elements of your game and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ fix them, because it's an awful first time experience that feels slow, unimaginative and clunky to play. Play Minecraft FTB or play Factorio, two vastly superior games. Thanks for the refund.",Not Recommended,3885,1.8 hrs on record,Posted: May 16

Amazing game. It's actually quite different from factorio in a lot of ways. No base defense, which makes it a much more relaxing game. Much prettier, and also a limited size map.

Unlike factorio though, which lets you automate just about everything, in satisfactory you need to build everything by hand which so far has been very satisfying, but we'll see how long that lasts.

Rather than being similar to factorio it's more like a factory automation type mod for subnautica, but without all the water of course.",Recommended,447,79.2 hrs on record,Posted: May 16

Games like Satisfactory are why I love gaming; it's something that can transport you mental to another world that you become totally immersed in. I'm not sure which aspect of Satisfactory I most enjoy, the building or the exploration. Both are immensely well conceived, executed, and most of all, fun to lose hours playing.
I only just recently got back into PC gaming, and Satisfactory has already made the investment worthwhile.
I can't wait to see what the developers add next.

FSSZilla,https://steamcommunity.com/id/FSSZilla/,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
I thought this was going to be a game only about optimizing your factory in an essentially sandbox environment. What I got was a rich game with a very well designed alien world to explore, with subtle messages about environmentalism and the beauty of nature contrasting with the efficiency of machinery. There are literally breathtaking vistas, vast beautiful cave networks, impossible alien landforms, and completely on point music and sound direction. The slightly sinister feeling nature of your FICSIT overlords lends some deep nuance; what are you actually doing here? What role are you playing, and who are you serving?

I'm not an optimizer. I enjoy efficiency, but I'm not one to overdesign to get there, so my bases end up having a naturalistic ""base camp"" feel, while my friends are building towering factories with rows and rows of machinery. I'm really glad to say, this game supports both playstyles fantastically. I see my friends having a blast designing and organizing monolithic black cubes full of layers and layers of machinery, whereas I love spreading out and nestling my machines in with the trees and cliffs.

The one thing I would dock this game for is that the ecosystem feels too player-focused. I want to see predators chasing prey and fighting other predators for territory. I want to see animals that consume resources, and possibly animals that caretake and develop their own resources as well. This might not be the game for that, and if you're also wanting to see an alien ecosystem spring to life, I highly recommend Subnautica. However, I can't deny the intentional design I feel in segments of this game. Collecting power slugs to me feels like collecting Missile Packs in Metroid. They are usually placed in areas that have a similar challenge feel to them, and are a wonderful reward for exploration. I can't wait to find out what Somersloops and Mercer Spheres are for, because they provide such an intense incentive to explore that I think is missing from some games like this.

There are still bugs and glitches, particularly with enemy AI. It's very rudimentary and when you master kiting enemies, they don't provide that much of a challenge, even with the Xeno-zapper. It's only when they congregate and team up against you that they feel like a challenge. On the other hand, that complexity is used to great effect in the placement of hostile mobs today, so I can't knock the simplistic AI too much because it combines and scales difficulty fairly well, despite the somewhat limited toolkit for designing these encounters.

Also, placing the Space Elevator is a religious experience. I don't care how jaded you are, it's a masterstroke of technology that that sequence plays out so organically and dynamically. You really *feel* the scale of the structure, and it changes the skyline forever.

I feel like there are still some quality of life hiccups around inventory management. As an FPS player, I often find myself hitting the number row to switch my in-hand equipment, only to remember too late that those hotkeys are for your building toolbelt. I'd love a way to switch between modes, even if it just means holding shift while pressing a number gets the build mode quickbar, and just pressing the number equips a new item to your hand slot. On the other hand, there are some very nice Quality of Life touches that I appreciate once I've gotten used to the quirks of this game. Actually placing buildings is decently streamlined, and I appreciate the way building off of foundations allows for a very granular angling. Once you're started building a foundation to fit the area, the 90-degrees snap-to-grid functionality feels very useful. The only complaint I have here is the sometimes janky feeling of trying to get conveyors to snap together. It can be very finicky about what counts as a valid angle, and the feedback isn't always clear about why a conveyor can't be constructed. ""Encroaching others' area"" ends up being a somewhat frustrating exercise of shimmying things around in minute ways just fiddling to get the lines all connected.

Honestly, though, the game is beautiful enough to warrant the price tag. I don't just mean graphics specifications and technical aptitude. The design of the game's assets and their placement creates spellbinding beauty. The way biomes flow into each other feels extremely organic and immersive, and I've never seen transitions so smooth in any other game. It feels like it surpasses Breath of the Wild in this respect, and some of this may be because setting this on an alien world helps smooth over any strangeness in geology or botany that would subtly break immersion otherwise. There are so many systems in this game to become familiar with, and the tech tree feels so rewarding and rich that it compels me to develop more and more. All in all, this is genius design. Mad respect.",Recommended,4079,58.9 hrs on record,Posted: May 15

A fantastic and unique builder, far unlike Valheim or Minecraft, it leans away from ""Adventure and danger"" and leans more into ""analysis and planning"". You still get to whack a few monsters, but the focus is on efficiency and placement. It seems restricting at first, but creating a factory in this game is one of the most creative experiences I have ever had in a game. Everyone should play this game, it's underrated.",Recommended,365,145.2 hrs on record,Posted: May 15

It has a few really ragged edges and parts that are still in production, but building is interesting. The tech tree is easy to work with and the 'training wheels' walk-through was helpful enough without being long winded. Then it was mass death at the hands of critters until I figured out how to fend them off. The show stopper is the world enviroment which is rich and interesting with different biomes and beautiful landmarks to utterly destroy with giant factories.

There is so much to this game you will be playing for a long time. It's all about building components, being more productive and whatnot. This game is very relaxing, not hardcore but will make you think. Only issue I can see from the hours i've played is that if you are playing on a friends server only the host can make routes for trucks/trains, ect. Not the end of the world to wait for them to set that up, can always build the factory so its all ready to go when your bud gets back. I really would recommend this game to anyone who love building games.

The amount of content is already mind boggling and i've barely scratched the surface of what is there.

This game was on my watchlist for so long. I finally bought it recently, because a friend got it.
I played 30 HOURS in 2 DAYS after getting this game. So yeah, it is really satisfying.
I thought this would be a game, for maybe 100 hours max, but after seeing some videos of what is possible in this game, I can see why people have houndreds, even thousands of hours. Ive just automated the ""base"" materials and havent even unlocked all technologies.
Great to play with friends as well, although desync issues are disturbing the otherwise clean gameplay.
This will definetly mean more hours of fun and grinding.
Some people say, that there is a lack of motivation because of the feeling of whataboutism in this game. You basically automate production to make parts to unlock new technologies which you can use to automate the production of even more parts. If you dont mind that and like base building games like this, I highly recommend this factory building gem.",Recommended,817,37.7 hrs on record,Posted: May 13

I suppose the name of the game speaks for itself and truly is ""Satisfactory"" :) My only issue is with the rocks that are 4-5 ft tall since it lets me build foundations through it and the grass showing after building on it as well.

If you have even remotely played Factorio, then you will LOVE this game!

Same vein of factory building on an alien planet, but vastly different on their goals and ""story"" (if you can call it that). The pure wonder I experienced when first seeing the planet upon planet drop was stunning and the game play flow got me hooked!

Everything is so well designed and intuitive that it just keeps you going hour after hour just like Factorio! One of my favorite parts about this is its vastly dense amount of biomes filled with the richest colors and designs, so much so that I can EASILY spend way too much time exploring in a vehicle or on foot all the nature there is, on such a HUGE map too!

On the factory side of things, machines are easily designed so that they can be tiled and laid out however you wish, and the shear complexity of it all is astounding! Of course, the further you get, the more complex it gets and you will always need to makes tweaks to your base, sometimes tearing it all down and rebuilding!

Great gameplay, stunning visuals, lots to see and explore, COUNTLESS hours of tasty conveyor spaghetti! HIGHLY recommend for fans of the genre!",Recommended,978,330.3 hrs on record,Posted: May 13

Really like the game, has lovely graphics and overall game play makes me want to come back and continue building my factories, coal plants and exploring the landscape.

However, I have hit a massive roadblock with Oil, to the point where I haven't placed since trying to get to some due to how hard and generally irritating it is to not only find it, but to actually get it anywhere useful due to the landscape or distance to base / factory.

I recommend this game, but I think it is only meant for a certain audience of people.

If you lack patience to learn from failure, can't do basic math for sh*t, or just don't like slow paced games, this probably isn't for you.

If you do enjoy these types of game just know it has a fairly large learning curve IMO, and you'll probably end up absolutely hating your first factory.

What I am saying sounds like I shouldn't be recommending it, but yet here I am. The game is extremely fun, satisfying, addicting, and relaxing despite all of it's flaws.

Super fun! Graphics, animations, sound design, and game mechanics are top notch. You can really tell they have put an immense amount of hard work into all the detail. Still some weird glitches in the environment, and I wish this game had full mod support. Game could also use some tension...like a countdown timer to an invasion or an environmental danger that you had to prepare for that you could optionally select. Just a suggestion.

SO, so many crashes. Once you hit end game its extremely boring and tedious. The most fun was killing the stingers (Spiders) but even the AI is really dumb. The fact you need mods to make the game remotely fun is dumb also.
Hazmat suit that you cant use in gas clouds.
Vehicles that shield you from radiation but not gas clouds.
No way to speed up the game like factorio.
You can breath underwater but not in gas clouds.
Trains take so long to unlock and once you hit cap on local nodes the rest are so far away and railway laying takes a long time.
Drones are expensive and you need at least two per node sometimes 3 to get full efficiency from it.
The ticket sink is frustrating and slow as is stacks and gets harder to get tickets.
Weak weapons that take a while to kill bigger enemies forcing you to fill your inventory.
A bigger inventory is gated behind tiers.
The vehicles chew through fuel. ""You are going only 1km to a couple of km's. Yet chews through lots of containers of fuel. SO glad my car doesn't do that or I never go anywhere
Power trips out a lot and can be extremely hard to get running again.
Overall. The game gets boring. It starts feeling like a chore trying to get stuff setup to the point where you stop caring about OCD because you've spent hours trying to get the factory running. Back and forth always getting resources. So many different materials are needed once you hit late tiers is extremely annoying. Most alternate recipes are useless or more expensive. Nodes are capped to belt speed even though you can overclock the miners to be faster, poor game design. The game suffers from extremely bad asset loading lag and is very unoptimised compared to other games using the same game engine. The trains, omg, no signals, clipping through each other, and no conditions like wait times or capacity setting.
Fluid pipes are so buggy and a ridiculous design.
Did I mention crashes? Don't turn off auto save like I did to record stuff for youtube then forget to put it back on. I lost a few hours of gameplay from game crashes and forgetting to save.

I can't go on grinding this game any longer. It's just so boring.",Not Recommended,1782,641.0 hrs on record,Posted: May 12

A beautiful factory building experience that scales up at a digestible and rewarding pace. The game begins with you using a pickaxe to mine ore and by the end of ten hours, you are automating and optimizing that process well more than 100x over. In order to accomplish your objectives, this scenario of 'scaling up' ensues at a seemingly sigmoidal growth rate (only if you're up to the task of setting up the necessary infrastructure.)

The exploration expands over treacherous territory- sudden pitfalls, steep cliff sides that rise up hundreds of meters, monsters that defend sought after upgrades, and resources that are great distances apart from one another. The objective is to create a network of factories that utilize the extraction and production from those resources in the most efficient way possible. If that sounds more like work than like gaming to you, then you might be right, because there is no shortage of online-manual-labor required to set up your brilliantly designed automated networks.

But don't be scared away- there is a peaceful aura to the scenery, a pleasing-to-the-ears synthwave-esque soundtrack. The mechanics are polished; the player has the mobility of a fast-paced FPS- able to sprint, jump, slide, fly, and drive, and wields no shortage of tools to play with. Moments of adversity are obscured by the serenity gleaned from looking out over your creations from far away and acknowledging the imprint your technology has made on the landscape.

In the overall process of completing the game, there are milestones to overcome represented by the newest and most difficult products to manufacture, which truthfully challenge your ability to manage your resources and time.

Totally worth the $30 USD to enjoy the game and support an awesome development team.
Highly recommend playing with a friend.

Completely recommend for anyone who enjoys factory-builder style games. Has potential to be a lot more, but there is already a decent modding scene for this game of which some are multiplayer friendly. By far one of the best early-access games.

Ran a faction-style server for a while (Players were only allowed so many nodes within X distance of their base) to try an economy style of map, worked out great & is where most of my hours went.

Really needs dedicated servers & more reliable online code. Had many instances of game crashes / people lagging despite an overkill host machine. But still early access & I'm sure they've said that's due soon(tm)",Recommended,562,205.3 hrs on record,Posted: May 11

Yes it was a good game, although with a team of 4 which is what I had that figured out the system early for production and had backgrounds in the field for machinery, this game only took about 50 hours to complete from start to finish having everything unlocked and done with. That being said the updates take forever to drop, you will be waiting about 3-6 months for any actual content that isn't holiday filler. Honestly you can buy it and have fun with it for a short while of time then wait for an update that will take ages.",Not Recommended,447,47.7 hrs on record,Posted: May 11

Satisfactory for me is a game which is enjoyable to play. Due to two reasons:
Firstly, there is a gigantic world to explore. So far I have been in caves, valleys, desert, plains, lake, and swamp. As an example, the graphic of the coral texture area has the most detail.
Secondly, the highly realistic and highly customizable building construction makes the player so satisfy to experience. Like the belts.
Since this game we play is Beta version (not finished game). I strongly suggest the game to add more varieties on minerals. Perhaps each mineral will only have only have a few recipes, this can allow the game to have more variables and interesting for experience to play. Moreover, adding some creature that produce bio martial is also recommended. This can add farming gameplay in the game which I think will be popular and interesting to play.",Recommended,727,64.6 hrs on record,Posted: May 11

At this time, I can't recommend the game. Without a lot of mods, it's just another nondescript factory building game. There is no end goal to aim for, just having things automated and optimised to prevent bottlenecks is the only aim the game has. The animals that attack you have a very basic AI which is far too easy to predict and counter and you only need to obtain the next weapon up to become practically invincible, you don't even need the rifle.

Sorry, but at this stage in time, it needs a LOT of work to make it worth playing in my view.",Not Recommended,463,246.4 hrs on record,Posted: May 10
CozyCable,https://steamcommunity.com/id/CozyCable/,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Overall Score 4/5
Satisfactory feels significant in the space it takes. I have thoroughly enjoyed my time playing and the blend between survival and factory building is executed amazingly.

Performance 3/5
At times when there are a lot of objects or buildings on screen, lag can start to creep in and cause stuttering. This doesn't happen too often and techniques such as hiding conveyor belts behind walls so that they aren't visible can help to alleviate the issue. However, during an autosave, the lag is noticeable and annoying no matter where you are on the map. Besides these issues, I manage to maintain high frames consistently with no issue and have yet to see my CPU or GPU throttle.


The gameplay feels smooth and so far I have come across a few fun glitches. I will say, that for an early access title, Satisfactory feels a lot more polished than others in recent memory. This game is what I wish Space Engineers played like, the graphics are clean and the building feels intuitive. When I have researched a new tier or construct a newly unlocked building for the first time, it truly feels like an accomplishment. The sense of satisfaction from automating a process that was once laborious is incredible and provides a real drive to play. The lack of a story aspect is bolstered by a growing world with a unique design and clear-cut goals that reward you with useful and significant upgrades.


The community that has been built around Satisfactory is accepting and altogether fun to be in. Players on forums and gathering places such as r/Satisfactory are kind and engaging. Sometimes it feels like it might take an architectural or engineering degree to sort out how to make the shiny new item you are after, but taking a step back and referring to the well-made guides and help from devoted players you will make it along fine. This attitude is reflected in a group of Devs that are committed to their craft and truly listen to their players. Their updates are always well anticipated and bring exciting features that add new horizons to the game for your creativity to explore.",Recommended,1756,33.6 hrs on record,Posted: May 10

Build stuff, in order to build stuff, that unlocks new tech that lets you build stuff.

Exploration is always amazing. Huge focus on movement and verticality. Jet packs, vehicles, jump pads, hyper tubes, trains, etc. Exploration is so good it rivals minecraft despite having a single map (albeit large).

This isn't factorio. It's less technical, easier to get into, more colourful. AND. The vertical elements bring a whole new feel to bases. Being able to ship things upwards, or create 3D factory cubes really let's your creativity for efficient design.. SHINE.

If you played factorio this would be a first person version of that except there is no pollution so alien wildlife doesn't attack your base. Alien wildlife does attack you on sight so there is a ""threat"" when you first start or are exploring.

THIS GAME IS AMAZING!!!!!! I don't know if it's just me, but for the last few years I feel there has been a real lack of imagination when it comes to game making. There has been some very big name game releases that I have looked forward to, and yet once they get released and you play for a few days or so, you've played through it all and these developers now-a-days TOTALLY FORGET ABOUT THE GAMES. They make their big chunk of money on the release and never go in and update content or add new things. These big companies release these huge games with so much potential, but they're only out for a dollar. Even if/when they release updates.. they want you to pay stupid amounts of money for them, and if you don't then you are left with a very vanilla game.

This game however, is constantly coming out with releases and new updates... I have put in close to 200 hours and I am still learning something new everyday, and there's soooooo much more to unlock! I've put that 200 hours in and that's just the first game I started with! There are more maps!!! I think you could truly spend a lifetime playing this game and still have things to do and learn.. and it's still in the early release stage!!!!!

I haven't been addicted to a game like this in years.. it brings back memories of the old COD Modern Warfare and Battlefield 3 days when ALL responsibilities went to the side because I couldn't put enough hours in! First time in a long time I have rushed home to play a game.. it actually gives me something to look forward to!! Even at work I am sitting there thinking of ways to improve my systems and what I'll do next!!!!!

GET THIS GAME, BUT BE WARNED YOU WILL NEVER WANT TO STOP!!!!

Big shout out to the mods and developers who continue to put time into this game and have finally sparked my gaming passion again! I would buy this game 10x over again, and not even for the new content.. but out of the principal that you can tell these guys want to make us happy and ensure we continue to love the game! That's worth something!

BUY IT!!!!",Recommended,1688,260.3 hrs on record,Posted: May 9

Honestly there is so much more to do than i thought there would be. The price of the game is a little bit high but since they are constantly updating the game it's reasonable.

The thing i love most of the game is actually the hud of the game, it's so clean and makes the game feel so much higher budget.

I'll update this later but here's my thoughts at 11 hrs in. The game is stunning. The environment, the creatures, the machines - all superb. I really enjoy hiking off toward the horizon and seeing what's out there. In fact, just wandering around checking stuff out is my favorite aspect of the game. The factory building makes me a little depressed - what's the word - ennui? Like what's the point? Is it just leveling up? No real plot or story or progression regarding why I need to spend hours making factories? What's the payoff? I know it's supposed to be satisfying to see a well run and organized operation but...eh. If that's all there is I don't think it will hold my attention for long.

If you are someone who needs to learn the concept of efficiency and if you are describing yourself as a perfectionist, you should play this game, NOW!

Whenever you realize the details that is thought by developer, you respect more.

I played 20 hours in 2 days. I can't stop thinking of it. Game design is perfect. Even if you are doing the same thing over and over, it doesn't make you feel bored since it makes the processes more efficient. Developers definitely assimilate the satisfaction feeling in game design and they present the feeling to player as it should be.

The last thing, if you are someone who wants to be engineer, especially system engineer or industrial engineer, you can get general understanding of how things work in a factory. You may encounter the problems that are experienced in real factory such as bottleneck.

At the time of writing this, the game has a ""Overwhemingly Positive"" rating. I feel this is overly generous. So to balance it out I will vote to not ""recommend"". Steam, please change your voting system.

Like other and very few negative reviews have pointed out, and I feel this is a bit unfair, but we live in the real world where a different game and probably the inspiration for this game exists, by the name of Factorio. Factorio is a game that better captures the essence of what Satisfactory is trying to accomplish.

What do I mean by this? Well, you need to place down buildings and transport stuff between them using conveyors, right? So this translates into a space management problem and playing this game in first person is a fatal flaw. It's very difficult to judge space in first person. This is why in real life we use things like plans on a piece of paper, which allows us to allocate space easily. It's like the idea started a gimmick: What if we could see our Factorio factory in first person, wouldn't that be cool? And then they made the game that way, missing the entire point. It's a step backwards down in game mechanics. If they add a top down view via a drone and a out of the box grid system, it would help greatly.

I found the game to be much simpler than Factorio, but way more tedious. Especially with manually having to collect fuel leaves to power your installation. You can't even hold it down. You have to hit your use key on every single flower. And you need THOUSANDS of them. My finger actually started to hurt. That can't be good for my hands...

It's not a bad game. It's better than average. It's probably even good. But it's definitely not ""overwhemingly"" so. It's not overwhemingly anything.

I can't express how great this game is. This is a true masterpiece of game development and is worth every dollar.

You can see yourself grow in this game, not just through the progression of the tier system but also through your own logic and problem solving skills. Each production line you set up will be better and you eventually see the pitfalls of your original implementation. You then can choose to refactor the setup completely or make slight adjustments to improve efficiency.

It is an amazing brain exercise. I can't remember the last time a game made me pull out a piece of paper to calculate and design something to be done in game.

It's okay.

It's not as refined as factorio and there seems to be a prevailing belief that the player wants to redesign their factories about 8 times before the end of the game.

Belting, splitting and merging could be handled better because certain resources like screws get used A LOT and the belts can't keep up in a single line and multi line are a pain in the ass to implement compared to factorio.

I'm not sold on the alternate recipes being ""discovered"" on hard drives. I feel like you should be able to research them or buy them from the sink shop to help reduce the randomness.

Game is still Early access. Single player is okay, but multi-player, it's noticeable. Lots of texture glitches with belts, rendered water that will kill you if you jump into it and areas you can fall through the map, make you not want to explore because you can lose everything in your inventory.

But of course you have to because of the Hard drive and power slug system.

At the time of this writing, this is the only game I'm playing. It's been a two months since I've played another another game. I probably should play something else to avoid burn out.

So thinking about playing another game then makes me think of all the things I need to do in the game. I actually have a task list written down on what I want to accomplish. That usually goes to hell when I get into the game and get distracted by something else I wanted to do. This game really focuses on efficiency of the machines you chain together but I'm definitely not running at 100% efficiency ;).

So the building aspect of this game is good but I'm not that good with design and mostly just stick with square and rectangle shaped buildings. The features of the game that I love the most is product automation and logistics. Regarding the latter, trains was a big game changer for me. This has allowed me to consolidate all the items I have in different parts of the world and I'm working on my first mega base too.

If any of this is what you like then this is the game for you and I hope this review helps you make that decision to play.",Recommended,939,"1,038.3 hrs on record",Posted: May 7

I enjoyed some of my time in Satisfactory, but I never got past tier 4 industry because I felt gated behind... building a factory. I enjoy the progression and the exploration, but I don't actually enjoy the factory-building portion of the game. The size of the machines and my closeness to them makes placement and arrangement difficult and tedious for me. I think the game would be greatly improved by a build mode in which is more like a city-builder top-down view. Of course I've heard that there's some kind of hover building thing later, but I haven't gotten to it. Maybe if that was moved to earlier in the progression I could enjoy the factory building.

Moreover there seems to be no overarching reason for progression and factory building other than for their own sake. There's no goal, no real threats (i.e. the bug attackers in Factorio), no point to doing anything other than the enjoyment of doing it.

Great game with incredible art design and performance. But personally I found it difficult to really enjoy.",Recommended,867,106.7 hrs on record,Posted: May 7

A critically addicting factory building sandbox with a dash of exploration and crazy environments. The game's progression system is brilliantly implemented in a way that makes sure you always have a goal to work towards, but enough freedom in how you want to accomplish it that you never lose the feel of a sandbox experience. Once you get the swing of the mechanics and start unlocking more buildings, tech, and cool gadgets, the game takes a thrilling spin and becomes a huge management sim of the coolest type.

this game truly brings out the autism hidden deep within you. never before have i thought that destroying a peaceful, happy planet by laying out endless kilometers of conveyor belts, clogging its atmosphere with an indescribable amount of co2 and completely annihilating every tree, resource or any other kind of gift from mother nature will be so fun.",Recommended,313,33.4 hrs on record,Posted: May 7

As of update four, this is the most fun game I've ever played. Exceeding my expectations. There are some annoying things about the game. How the environment is not yet destructible. That is my soul complaint. I expected it to be, considering it is a building game. I feel as if it was almost designed into the game, yet removed for now. I can play this for a very long time without realizing 9 hours went by. I usually do. This game makes me wish for improvements. To the Adventure aspects. As of right now. There are only 3 types of gathering objects that improve base(all with the same skin but different color.) There are only 3 enemy classes. Those that shoot you, those that attack you, and those that HOLY OMG WHAT IS IT (BURN IT WITH FIRE.)
And while that is fun. I would like to see further variation on enemies. As well as cute little animals you could befriend. There is only one of those.
I'd also like to see and expanse into the areas you might enjoy. So if you build until endgame (which I have NOT currently reached.) I'd like to see more opportunity/purpose/reason for building (missions, milestones, and rewards.) My current insensitive for building is OMG this is so cool. But I can imagine a game, exactly like this, that gives me incentive(in the form of more content,) as I mentioned.

So to recap. Game is a solid 9/10 or 10/10 game, even in its current version. But
You need varied enemies. Not just what it has now. (Water enemies are an idea, as well as a weapon to fight those, however those may get annoying too. So probably bad idea, just brainstorming here.)
You need more of a research tree that is harder, but gives a better reward. (It just sort of takes 3 seconds for to Finnish almost half of it and progression feels cheap. Its called ""The MAM"" but its a research tree.)
You need to give more options for varried buildings and building types. Its not ""barebones"" however, i'd love to see this game grow with a direction of say ""creative mode."" Or, ""creative lobbies."" As well as more buildable items to meet those modes head on. I believe more stuff to build would expand the world into the realm of WOW THIS IS EPIC instead of just OMG This is cool.

There are probably a million ways to improve the game, but I understand the game they gave me. I love the game they gave me. But even if you play, 24 hours or less, you'll realize, this game is AWESOME
Even if you don't have some suggestions, like me, on what they could improve, even if your critical of gameplay, even if you're thinking, should I buy this? The fun of this game, comes from playing this game. Exploring this game, and building in this game. An area you never knew, eventually becomes a base, or a part of your base. Its truly unique, as I have NEVER played a game like this. Buy this game.",Recommended,2303,120.3 hrs on record,Posted: May 7

This game is more than the sum of its parts. It has an addicting core loop of needing a rare material, exploring to find it, using it to build things to automate previous resources, before needing too much of it and needing to automate that. The movement system of slidehopping to jump far and fast is exciting, the multiplayer is fleshed out, with the ability to see the holograms of what other's are building, something I've never seen in a game before.

Strangely addictive game play.

At first you are just running around exploring what can be done. Then you begin to realize the largest limitation is your own preconceived restrictions. There is no box... don't try to think within one.

Yes, floors can float with nothing supporting them. Floors are the key to building vertically because they allow you to build above structures without being blocked.

Automation is the key. Then you find that the amount of resources required for more advanced items will change all your ratios of items you thought you needed to build earlier.

Honestly, such a labour of love.

I am no engineer, nor am I particularly mechanically minded. The closest I've gotten is putting a chain back on a pedal bike. But by god do I love this game. Everything about it is so immersive and intriguing. Would highly recommend! Also, I really want someone to play with. This game has multiplayer and I am quietly confident I have discovered most of what the single player has to offer (minus a few of the research things) so I really want to build a factory with someone else!

Also, the amount of updates coming out of here are amazing!! And there is still so much to look forward to. Like the alien artefacts, for instance. Can't wait to find out what they are for.
Also the alien shrimp dog bunny pet thing. I'd love an update with just stuff for that little guy, like a kennel for example, and maybe a bow tie.

The way the tiers work in this game is absurd. They have extremely high requirements, like an old facebook or mobile game, so it sucks up a ridiculous amount of time. You end up running around with a chainsaw to collect biofuel to use to power the generators, and its boring and monotonous.

You don't know what you need, until you need it. You need coal power, so you don't have to babysit the generators, however there's no map until later game. Jesus christ. I just spent an hour wandering through the game, not being able to pathfind properly, only to give up on the coal power, because I arrived at a node that wasn't close enough to water, because I didn't have Copper sheet rolls (or whatever they're called). Tried to find the other node and it was to difficult to get to, no map again. Finally give up and head back to main base, barely 50 rotors were constructed, need 200 for whatever upgrade.

Seriously, why are there no solar panels? Needed to consult a map online to find anything, which was irritating. This seems to cater to engineers.",Recommended,882,63.6 hrs on record,Posted: May 5

I made a launcher that throws me cross map into a pool of jello to stop my corpse from going absolutely flying into the abyss. I love it!

This game was way longer and way more in depth than I expected. Ive only now began to make progress to get stage 4 and there are 5 in total. I thought it would get repetetive after a while but somehow keeps you entertained all the way through. The only problem is that you have to explore way more than I'd hope for. I keep running out of overclocks that make your factory work at up to 250% speed. Its really well optimised and even if you have a GIANT factory with over 1000 things being moved at the same time you will not lag. Multiplayer is getting way more stable and me and my friend have only experianced minor problems.

All in all I'd say go for it, it's great fun to play alone or with buds. 9/10",Recommended,700,95.9 hrs on record,Posted: May 5

Honestly, I generally don't leave reviews, but this game is interesting, addictive, sandboxy, challenging and rewarding.

Open world, survival base building, tech tree researching, resource balancing satisfaction.

You start on an alien world, dig up resources, arrange electricity, automate resources (smelting, making rods etc) then go from there, increasing your tech tree from making screws to nuclear fuel control rods.

I don't usually write reviews, but this game deserves it: everything about it is just perfect! There are so many aspects of it to keep you fully engaged: resource hunting, creating new production lines and improving old ones and unlocking new materials and recipes through the tiers, space elevator and research.

This game is masterfully crafted, there is never a moment of boredom because there is always something new to do: improving the power grid because you put down new machines that build new components, meaning you need to tweak your old production line to make it more efficient and maybe hunt down some resource nodes to upgrade your raw material input.

The progression is also very well engineered: you start from zero, having to do everything manually until you can automate the process and then, as you unlock more things, the production lines get more and more complex, requiring some clever thinking and planning to make it as efficient as possible.

There is also a multiplayer aspect, so you can build your factories with friends, even though I personally don't care for that.

And the game isn't even finished yet! But it is already so great! I very highly recommend this game!",Recommended,1019,46.4 hrs on record,Posted: May 5

I don't even know where to begin, this game is amazing, no need to wait for the full release, there is a ton of content to play through as is. Don't expect any story or even an in depth campaign, it's more of a sandbox with some overarching goals but chasing those goals is incredibly fun and addictive.

While the world is quite large and pretty to look at, the combat and exploration is a bit shallow, however the real meat of this game is in planning and constructing the most efficient mega factories that you can dream up. The building systems seem simple at first but as you unlock more elements to build with the possibilities open up quite a bit, throw in vehicles and all sorts of character equipment like parachutes and jetpacks for some added fun and it's a nearly perfect mix. I've been playing for over 300 hours across both steam and the original release on the epic store and I still find myself daydreaming about it all the time.",Recommended,791,178.2 hrs on record,Posted: May 4

Delightfully complex and beautiful, with a rich tech tree and amazing graphics. If you want a peaceful building experience, Be sure to get the Satisfactory Mod Manager application so you can turn off enemies (search for passive mode). This made the game 10x more fun for me, and I enjoyed many late nights solving production puzzles, exploring the lovely world, and creating a giant mega factory city without the stress of having to kill or be killed.

I spent over a 1,000 hours playing Oxygen Not Included. I wasn't sure if I would like this game, but wanted to give it a try because the reviews were so positive. About 35+ hours in after purchasing it this week, I can say that it's a blast. There is plenty of room to expand your base and explore. It scratches the base building and problem solving itch. The only complaint I have is that your resources are not finite, so you don't need to worry about resource management.

I would recommend this game because for me personally I like automation and stuff related to it. The game as well lets you do a lot of things so that you don't bored easily. I also like how the game gives you the freedom of exploring the whole world without limitations except world barrier but that's not an issue for me rn because the world is too big and I only played this game for 106hrs so there's still a lot to explore. Another one is that the game lets your build factories almost endless as well building complex factories which is also fun if your trying to build a efficient and organize factory. Lastly the best part of the game is that they have amazing animations as well models for the machines/player equipment's which is cool to watch and to look at. For me personally I would say the difficulty of this game is average because the game is not too easy and not hard. But of course it will depend on your experience if your a newbie or an expert. The environment of the world is also amazing because it doesn't feel too blocky but instead it feels alive and not lonely. Sound Tracks of the game is once again amazing. Stuff I would like to see in the future updates which I think will be amazing.
1. More Vehicles for all transportation types
2. More creatures and an increase of alien spawn groups.
3. Player elevators/Vehicle Elevators - Useful if your trying to have your vehicles somewhere high up.
4. Refined mod but instead its in the base game
5. Maybe small villages/trading stations with NPCs",Recommended,1263,135.4 hrs on record,Posted: May 4

Worst $30 I have ever spent. Bought the game to play with friends and while they seem to enjoy it, I have only found a wellspring of misery in my time with the game thus far. I will give the game that the base building is generally pretty good when you are in a cooperative terrain setting but the need to trouble shoot your power supply and the resource optimization process makes this game require a Rain Man mentality that I just don't have. Everything else on the other hand...

First off, I don't think this game benefits from any way, shape, or form from being a survival game. Combat is horrendous, and makes Minecraft's look like a mechanically in depth masterpiece in comparison. Usual best policy is just to avoid it all together, but sometimes exploration forces your hand and you have to engage with this unsatisfying system. Hits feel weightless and the weapons themselves feel like parodies. Exploration itself is also deeply frustrating, with poison clouds and difficult to navigate obstacles constantly barring your path. It takes hours of work to unlock equipment to assist with the tedious expansion process and the vast majority of these tools are just useless. Vehicles struggle to navigate the terrain and provide nothing more than a few seconds of amusement from seeing the cybertruck fly through the air on the launch pad.

I really wanted to like this game, but my experiences of constant frustration with glitches and death have prevented me from finding anything more than a few fleeting moments of pleasure.",Not Recommended,1294,13.9 hrs on record,Posted: May 3

this game is so addictive. the primary loop is fairly simple to learn and provides lots of enjoyable problem solving. i feel like i figure out a system for doing stuff... then figure out a better one for each major project i worked on. and once you get a factory setup and you're waiting for it to finish building the parts you need for the next unlock there's lots of exploration to do.

i also felt like my exploration game progressed as a series of distinct phases. and i learned different methods based on the available game mechanics. from running around on the ground... to using the truck to go explore new areas... and then using the foundations to make paths above the dangers on the ground. to using power lines and the hover pack to get to wherever i want with minimal issues from the hostiles.

the game also has some really nice quality of life features for these sorts of crafting chain setups. like giving you the items per minute values for the inputs and outputs of the building.",Recommended,836,533.2 hrs on record,Posted: May 3

Among other factory games Satisfactory is very friendly and somewhat easy, - which is not a bad thing at all.
Mines never run out of resources and the wildlife never destroys your buildings, so when a production flow is established, then it can run forever.
Which is great, as you will establish a lot of production flows, ... and in good and bad that is what this game is. :-)
There is not much of a challenge or puzzle as there are plenty of resources and space. So you play this game to enjoy building huge production lines step by step in a very beautiful world. At times it can feel frustrating slow to reach the next milestone, but then relax, expand your current productions and in time that milestone will be reached.",Recommended,614,118.7 hrs on record,Posted: May 3

Does a great job of giving the player the ability to make and manage their own automation of different materials from different regions around a pretty huge, realistic looking map, and has some hostile mobs to give the player more challenges while creating said automation. Game has some glitches, mainly in multiplayer, but that is expected in early access. The game overall is great, and reminds me a little bit of Ark Survival evolved, but without a whole lot of PVP. I haven't gotten that far in the game, but it continues to hold my attention. Overall, I would recommend.",Recommended,495,56.4 hrs on record,Posted: May 2

Even in it's early state, the game delivers. The tech-trees and assembly-trees make sense, the reason why you have to unlock stuffs is reasonable and the overall design is neat. Until now, I haven't encounter any bug, glitch or crush. The only weird thing I have found, it's how the foundations and base building don't suppress or cancel environmental elements such as grass or trees, making your steel floors looking odd with grass growing through it, but that is just nitpicking.

Free at last from the evil ones and their ""Exclusivity"" monopoly. It's now on the platform it was meant for. The game itself is... satisfying. Once you get these production lines running and get a good power grid going, it's a great feeling. It's pretty easy to run maxed out. I get a mostly flawless 60fps at 1080p with everything on ultra with my Ryzen 7 1700 and GTX 1070. The only major con is that it stutters like a bad Unity game regardless of settings, even on several SSDs and PCs. It is early access, but man that desperately needs fixing. I just beat Valheim in it's current version's turbo stuttering, so a stutter free game would be great. Still worth it though.",Recommended,570,78.1 hrs on record,Posted: May 1

mar3usmc,https://steamcommunity.com/id/mar3usmc/,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
As of 20210501, I can not recommend this game to those that like this genre (Automation, exploration).

TLDR

The game has a great deal of potential to be good fun. However, the design decision to not have any sort of challenging combat mechanics, or some sort of challenging aspect that could actually cause you to lose, produces a game that is extremely superficial, mediocre, and boring.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The odds of you dying in this game are very remote (I still haven't died). The graphics are subpar for a 3D game. Sounds and Music are mediocre at best. The game mechanics are superficial and very simple. Attempting to build vertically is incredibly unrealistic in that structures do not require any support. You can have a floating base if you like.

There is no macro progression in the game either. No blueprinting. Nothing I hate more than having to repeatedly build the same design over and over.

I suggest looking elsewhere, such as Factorio, Oxygen not Included, or even Space Engineers if you really want 3D. At least those games will create some form of challenge are are by far more mechanically intricate and interesting.

90 hours in and I really can't find the fun in this game. Perhaps they will rectify this by the time they leave early access. I will check back once they do, but from what I gather so far I doubt this will happen.",Not Recommended,1253,90.3 hrs on record,Posted: May 1

Satisfactory is quite robust and nicely balanced throughout the play-through despite its current early access state. Some things like recipes do need to be refined, however they're so small that its not too much of importance. As well as despite having an unstable multiplayer experience, it is still fun to play as long as not more than 3 people are involved and stick together since the desynchronization issues, only appear to pop up when building factory buildings aside from the platforms. It's a good attempt to add multiplayer and having it work instead of refusing to add multiplayer in the first place.

In summary, good overall, needs some ficsit fixing ;P.",Recommended,576,570.0 hrs on record,Posted: April 30

seriously get this game if you like any form of factory building, even if you dont I highly recommend checking out videos to see if you'll like it or not. Im not super big on factory games (although ive had fun in a few, just not my fav type of game) but like yesterday ive played this game for like 15 hrs straight (atleast 12 hrs was me actually there, ive had some breaks)

Ive actually had so much fun with this game, I highly recommend ATLEAST giving this game a chance if it doesnt spark your intrest right away. I will say, that at times this game can be buggy though, its not a PERFECT game, its still in Early Access, but is it worth $30 USD? 100%",Recommended,547,97.2 hrs on record,Posted: April 30

Satisfactoy is a mix between Factorio and a FPS. It's just as addicting as Factorio. Absolutely worth the money(Bought during a sale). Way too much fun pressing a big button after every milestone and then use the new content to upgrade your factory.

One small issue. What the hell is up with the Epic Games and Steam integration? I spent way too long staring at the options and just chose to do Steam-only. Solution to this problem would be to have your own account system just like Factorio has.

Excited to see what the devs bring to this game. Hope for mod support through the Steam Workshop.

Let me start by saying that I am VERY picky when it comes to beta games - generally speaking, I avoid them like the plague and over the years I have found them dis-satisfying and a waste - however I am delighted to say that is not the case with Satisfactory!

Currently gone through 2/3 games exploring different starting locations - different methods of building and the game leaves it entirely up to the played on how to manage their Factory.

Overall the gameplay is fantastic - I hope to see future PVE or monster interactions in the future, but even as it stands right now - it is an absolute pleasure which will allow you to explore and satiate all of your OCD needs. Whether you want to organize and balance all of your machines, or simply throw things together - this game has something for everyone! - and the updates keep on coming!

At the time of posting (4.29.21) the game is a bit rough around the edges but thoroughly enjoyable. It is best described as a beautiful blend of the factory building of Factorio, the survival aspect of Minecraft, and the open-world exploration of Horizon Zero-Dawn. The graphics are great, and the overall atmosphere is akin to a walk through a dream.

There are a few things still that need improvement, namely how entities can clip through the environment (especially belts and powerlines), and that several items that currently exist in the game but serve no purpose. Judging by the rates of updates to the game I would expect both of these to be addressed before it is considered 'Completed'.

Was definitely a bit surprised how much this game actually has to offer. Potentially one of if not the most well made factory-based automation game I've played. An immersive atmosphere on an alien planet, similar to that of No Man's Sky, but more lively. The ability to start from absolutely nothing and grow and maintain an efficient (or spaghetti mess) factory is beyond rewarding.

Though what makes this game special to me, is the ability to pause what you're doing, look up, and see a realistically scaled factory that you spent the last 10 hours or more working on. Everything animated and alive, everything towering over you with countless conveyor belts moving resources that were all placed for a reason. The game is actually beautiful, and runs incredibly well for how nice it looks. And that's just the visual aspect.

What blows my mind about this game is how in-depth it is. Not only in content, but with how much planning and math is involved to achieve what you want to do. There is a steep learning curve here, and the skill cap is practically limitless. I've spent so much time outside of the game just planning and thinking in my head or even on a notepad on how to improve my factory, how to do something more efficiently while still making it look nice. This however can be incredibly overwhelming and stressful, but playing efficiently is a preference. The game will always keep you with stuff to do, stuff to work on, stuff to plan out, and will keep your brain thinking nonstop. In my opinion this is the ultimate game of logistics.

My only complaints in the current version of the game are lack of a creative mode (place anything and plan anything with everything unlocked), and lack of reason for combat to actually exist in the game other than a research tree and filler content to do when expanding / exploring. The game has great potential to add onto combat and give it an actual purpose. Powerful items, boss enemies, using assemblers / manufacturers to craft an item to defeat a strong enemy are just a few of my own ideas. Right now combat just feels like a pointless extra, and more annoying than rewarding or fun.

Tldr; game is brilliant, beautiful, well made, fun, addictive, satisfying, and worth every penny. This is a great game if you want to keep your brain active, pass the time, enjoy basebuilding, and / or enjoy automation / logistics. It just has a steep learning curve but it's well worth the time and the progression is well made for learning how to play. This game is satisfactory.",Recommended,2107,280.0 hrs on record,Posted: April 29

You looking to satisfy your building itch? You will not be satisfied. You will delete everything you built and start over with a clearly superior floor plan. Then, you will sink hours into automating everything known to man and choose which of the endless tasks available you wish to complete. And then, you'll realize you didn't understand a basic mechanic, your base is 3 kilometers from the nearest node you presently need, and you'll need to rethink and rebuild everything.
You won't be satisfied. You won't stop. Your building itch will turn into a chronic issue as you try to resist the urge to look at forums for floor plans.
If you want to give in to the need to build, this game will enable that.",Recommended,600,63.6 hrs on record,Posted: April 28

Unbelievably addictive. Factorio always turned me off because of its graphics, but the ""optimize ALL the things"" approach is alive and well here. Lots to do, lots to explore, a real feeling of being a prospector when you venture out to find new resource nodes and try to connect them to your network... never thought this might be the kind of game for me, but holy hell did I get sucked into it.

Other positives: Great humor, beautiful enviroments and vistas, fun vehicles (mostly).

A bit more creature variety would be nice, but that's a very minor point.

Short review:

If you love games like Factorio or, more recently Dyson Sphere Program, you should really enjoy this game. It took me about 1000 hours of game time to finally ""win"" and accomplish the top tier production for the space elevator which is where the game ends right now. it was a hell of a ride to get there!

Where else are you going to get 1000 hours of entertainment for $30? Seriously?

I've played this game for much longer than Steam shows, because I've purchased this game twice now. Coffee Stain has outdone themselves with this game. They've always made great games, but this one is quickly going to make its way to the top of my ""most played"" list. Yes, it's pretty much Factorio in first person, but that changes the dynamic in a HUGE way, and it's not as much you vs. the environment like it is in Factorio, it's you versus your need to fix everything to be perfect. No, I didn't just spend the last 5 hours redoing the beltwork in my factory because two belts were overlapping, why would you ask, that? *cough* Anyway, I highly recommend this game.",Recommended,567,25.1 hrs on record,Posted: April 28

Okay first off this game is extremely fun with or without your friends this game is about progression and working to build up your factory. This game is kind of like a tycoon game in space. It is very chill and calming to play really no risk of dying and losing everything unless you jump off a cliff with a full inventory of valuables. This game is/can be a mental challenge for your brain which can be fun to challenge your mind with electrics and mechanics and machines in the game. This game is a sit back and relax kind of game. There really is no adrenaline rush however if youre coming from pvp games. So to sum up this review
MUST BUY if you are into tycoon games and like having a fun chill experience with/without your friends
Definitely worth the 30$
A fun challenge for your brain/mind

This game is HIGHLY addictive.

This is one of those games that you can play for hours and hours. At first, the game might feel overwhelming, but don't quit or give up. You learn things as you go, once you find a good spot and place your first drill and start building is when it gets addicting. You can get so creative with the way you build and configure your factories, conveyors, power machines etc. This is a great game to chill and spend hours on, and of course it is satisfying seeing your factories and machines come alive.

Very fun game when it comes to actually planning and creating factory lines and resource management.

The combat system is an absolute joke however. There are no real weapons and the best weapon available is a stick that you can swing at enemies twice before a 2 second cool down. There is no strategy to it at all and often times you will die to more powerful enemies over and over because there is no good way to beat them.

I have found myself spending hours spending resources to get gear to try to recover my body, only to die over and over again. The game deletes your items if you leave your session so basically if you get tired of trying to recover your body and want to quit, you lose everything.

I am giving this game a thumbs up because it is enjoyable to play when you are actually able to actually plan out a factory. The combat system is just an annoyance and it does not need to be there. This game has been out for 5 years and they still have bugs and huge needs for QOL improvements (ledge grab please!).

This game is really very good, and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys puzzles, automation/factory building, and aesthetic crafting.

The factory building element is very rewarding, there is no blueprint function so everything has to be placed by hand. Some may call this tedious, but the way in which all the parts interact is important and can be done well and badly depending on how you choose to approach it. The game also includes a number of stylistic and quality of life type objects that you can unlock to enhance how things look/work.

Researching new technologies and parts is approached in 3 ways: recycling excess materials, crafting new complex parts to unlock milestones, and map exploration to find alternate recipes and new resources. The map exploration element really makes this game exciting and interesting, as you are forced to search further afield for new exotic resources to feed into your factory.

The recent update adds a proper ""end game"" with a stupendously complex set of recipes to craft in order to finish the game. The scaling of the technologies in general is very well done, and you always feel like the next step is challenging yet obtainable. Each milestone you unlock gives access to new parts, which normally require new recipes and layouts to add to the factory.

Multiplayer works but has some de-sync issues occasionally. The devs are very open about the fact that multiplayer is a Work in Progress, but it's still playable and really fun with friends. The solo game is also super gratifying, as everything you achieve is your own doing, and your friends can't mess up your perfectly tuned assembly line.

If you're still unsure, you'll get a good feel for the game in the first 2 hours as there isn't a lengthy scripted tutorial, so try it out and refund it if you don't like it.",Recommended,1538,187.6 hrs on record,Posted: April 27

Do you like engineering? Do you enjoy putting systems together, re-factor(y)ing, and making your system ever more efficient and pleasing over time? Do you have the urge to wack funky alien birds while stealing their natural habitat away from them?

If the answer to any of the above was in the affirmative, buy this game. It is indeed satisfying.

Caveat:
This game is in early access and has some issues. Personally, the most annoying of these is the frequent stuttering, which happens even on my pretty sweet PC. I have looked into this and I believe the devs mentioned that the issue stems from the way the world is streamed. Damn I hate this bug, it has killed me a number of times when fighting off some beefier creatures. However, the rest of the game feels pretty solid and I am impressed with the amount of stuff to find / build / research / craft.

Spawned, followed tutorial, got into a fight with giant super aggressive beasts that tried to kill me, tried to fry them with the zapper, the zapper was totally useless, I got killed. Respawned, with no weapon, had to take a hike to get the weapon back, got into the same issue. The zapper gives you ""no tactical advantage whatsoever"". Died 3 times like that. Last time i died i tried to just flee, they killed me. I don't see where the fun is, so i requested a refund. But people seem to like it.

A game with just enough peaceful animals to make you feel bad for planetary exploitation, and just enough harmful animals to make you say ♥♥♥♥ them kids, and with just enough beautiful terrain to make you think twice about massive, ugly factories, but with just enough flat land to make you a colonialist sympathizer, this game truly brings out the worst capitalist desires of man.

With all of that being said, I really do recommend this game. It's everything younger ever wanted from those OLD old Roblox tycoon games and minecraft redstone, and its easy as hell to sink 100+ hours in.

A great time-waster. As the title suggests, incredibly satisfactory. I havent played many other factory management/creation games, like Factorio, but I have played somewhat similar games like Dyson Sphere Sim., and Mindustry. Satisfactory, from what i've heard about Factorio, is a 3D version of it with more emphasis on large base building then exploration or survival. You start off at tier one, and work your way up by upgrading or completing tasks in The Hub to unlock new categories, blocks, extra inventory space, etc, and use the Space Elevator to unlock the next duo of tiers (3+4, 5+6, 7+8, etc) by sending Project Parts into it. To summarize- a crap ton of time required and a crap ton of glorious automation. I highly reccomend if you like any factory management/creation sim. Is good.

Satisfactory is - and I keep forgetting this - in Early Access. I forget this because it is not plagued with glaring empty spaces or problems like many Early Access titles are.

Satisfactory is a sandbox production / management sim in a nutshell. It can be played alone or in multiplayer online. The multiplayer though is the most obvious sign of the Early Access state of the game. Vanishing objects and UI bugs plague the multiplayer. However, it is still a good time.

When experienced in solo, Satisfactory feel remarkably polished. The visuals are nice though obviously not AAA. The movement for the player feels good. It is smooth, simple and even quite entertaining. You can slide jump (Sprint - crouch - jump - release crouch) much like in Apex Legends for quite a nice speed boost. While I'm sure this wasn't intended, it is JUST easy enough to get a taste of but just tight enough on the timing to be a good minigame to play with yourself as you move about. I am constantly slide jumping lol.

Satisfactory has a solid tutorial opening for the player (skippable but I advise playing it) and doesn't hang itself up much on having a reason to exist. They introduce you to your employer and just leave it at that, giving them some lore to make a few fun jokes with but not much else. This is nice because it doesn't get in the way but at least it exists.

The gameplay is... well, it is good. You connect machines to belts to resource nodes to other machines... and the whole thing is a giant puzzle, art project and checklist all at once. I love playing this game while chatting in discord with friends even if we all play solo. Great stuff, highly recommend.",Recommended,1388,124.1 hrs on record,Posted: April 26

This game is pretty great for those who like the satisfying look of dozens to hundreds of machines working in perfect unison for no apparent reason. I certainly have had fun for this first 100 hours. Some thing to keep in mind though, is that this game is still in development. For single player, that's actually not a big deal. It works and looks great (conveyor belt heaven babe).

A great game, but it suffers from early access syndrome

collision are often a bit buggy on certain models, for example the HUB,
multiplayer itself is a bit buggy but the people behind the game are aware of this

Edit: Recently Im having severy problems with the stability of my game, it freezes often, sometimes it makes the whole game freeze, sometimes it comes back to live, it is really a bummer so such a good game, I would still recommend it, but if this keeps going ill have to write to support to help me out",Recommended,519,21.2 hrs on record,Posted: April 26

As someone who grew up playing Minecraft Mods such as Tekkit and other factory modpacks, this game resonates heavily with me and many others. Despite being an early access game, it plays as though it is a AAA full game. It is so much fun to play this for hours, just listening to music while playing at my own pace. Along with this there is an awesome, friendly community and also devs that truly care about their playerbase. There is also mod support which is a positive.

Have you ever played a game that takes you by surprise at how good it is?

Satisfactory did that to me.

I started it in lieu of the adventures i could have on a foreign world, facing exotic wildlife and building weapons to fight them. Soon, I realised I had stopped worrying about those critters, and was more interested in whether or not my floor blocks lined up perfectly. ""How can I place blocks in two different areas and line those squarely?""
Then came the period of micro factories. Then came the power cuts from over exuberant assemblers....
""Rather let me start again, now that I've learnt better methods.""
Rinse, repeat, get next level of tech. ""I better start again, so i can incorporate these parts into the process next time...""
and so on.

In short.

The graphics are surprisingly good, especially player movement from a 3rd person perspective.
The atmosphere is strange, weird and engaging...what one would expect when exploring an alien world.
and most importantly, The game play is fantastic and there are many many hours waiting for you with replayability only limited by your imagination.

Sigh..okay, fine.
Satisfactory is amazing, okay? It scratches so many of those survival/crafty game itches and i'm so addicted to it...SO DAMN ADDICTED TO IT. Coffee Stain are working extremely hard to make this game incredible (At least, I think they are, I don't know them O_o)

From the start, the tutorial and the phases of building slowly stack on the complexities while at the same time, rarely feeling unbalanced or leaving you questioning ""Okay, now what?"", the world is kinda small in some ways, however there's several biomes to explore all with different threats and benefits. Now, when I say the world is small, it isn't necessarily a bad thing as fast transportation options are limited so reaching one side of the map to the other feels like an accomplishment.

It is just one of many accomplished moments you'll feel playing through the hours of content this game already has.

The only important thing missing regarding the play mechanics i think is some incentive to actually aim for efficiency (like pollution and resource scarcity in Factorio).
While you can think a lot about efficiency here, there's no real reason to do so currently (besides power usage maybe, but that's not as big of an issue)",Recommended,300,116.9 hrs on record,Posted: April 25

Satisfactory. For my time playing it, i have been loving it. I love the atmosphere, the mystery behind the alien landscapes, making and building your own working factory.
-
The game is all about creating a working factory on an alien life formed planet.
To get your materials you are harvesting from the natural environment, smelting the resource, and then crafting them by hand. Gathering the right quantity needed for building your working machines, making your factory, bigger, resourceful, and orderly. Making such a big factory though- is also like puzzle solving, figuring out the technical sides of it, making it all work, as well as finding the right placements for each machine so it can all work in harmony with each other.
Then-
On the other side of things.
There is the open world around you. You are surrounded by a strange, unusual alien planet. With weird plant life, creepy hostile creatures, where you either have the choice of running for your life, or fighting your way through (For more alien life formed resources...) or cute little neutral creatures, that are either shy of you, or just out right not interested. The environment is dangerous, mysterious, and keeps you asking for more, and exploring more, while your factory is working back at home.

In short - This game has a variety of everything, it is entertaining, and laborious, with a hint of combat, mystery, and excitement.",Recommended,1194,15.0 hrs on record,Posted: April 25

The benchmark in factory building games

Satisfactory is an extremely fun highly rewarding game. From the beginning, being dropped onto a hostile planet with nothing but a prerecorded computer voice to guide you, the size and detail of the world will immediately draw you in. The amount of immersion the developers created is something to be cherished and is lost in a lot of games these days.

The object of Satisfactory is to explore the world, discover resources to mine, research technology to create the biggest and most optimized factory that you can. The game will give you a loose set of goals to reach in a step by step way and set you free to basically do what you want. The amount of freedom you are given to explore and build as you want is one of Satisfactory's strongest selling points.

The game is still in early access but it doesn't feel like it all. There is a mountain of content that has already been added to the game and the developers are constantly adding more as the months go by. There are some great and very detailed YouTube guides that can can watch to get you started if you feel like getting a bit of help. The feeling of adding a new wing to your factory, researching a new technology or shooting a ton of materials up a gigantic space elevator leaves you with a satisfying feeling worthy of the name of this game.

Satisfactory is definitely worth the price, actually it is an absolute steal if you like this genre of game. What will you get for your money? Hours and hours of fun whether you are planning on playing this solo or with some friends as well as a 'Ill just finish this last section and then go to bed' kind of feeling. I highly recommend giving this game a try you will not be disappointed!",Recommended,1441,28.5 hrs on record,Posted: April 24

Pro's:
- Has quite a lot of buildings.
- Has quite a lot of options on where to build.
- Good graphics.
- Has good potential.

Cons':
- Cannot alter terrain.
- Lack of endemic life (and variety).
- Cannot bind tools (such as weapon, chainsaw, beacons) to hotkeys.
- Placing big buildings feels clunky on low ground due to FPS view.

Although the game is great with diversity in buildings there is a major issue currently.
There is no way to alter terrain like flattening, raising or digging.
Half the time your buildings are clipping through terrain.
Building to make it look good is a massive pain due to the way building from first person is rather slow (especially when the buildings are big).
This really becomes an issue when placing floors/walls.
You constantly have to stack floors on top of each other (and for performance, remove the bottom floor) in order to elevate floors enough to not clip through ground.
For those like me who have OCD lining things up neatly this requires way too much patience and mind you i have quite the patience when it comes to building games.
Also there seems to be a lack of endemic life at the moment, it really needs more for it to feel alive, more diversity in lifeforms as well.
Cannot recommend this until these issues have been addressed.
Some minor issues with being unable to assign tools to hotkeys and placing big buildings from ground level (mainly due to inability to alter terrain).",Not Recommended,1218,109.1 hrs on record,Posted: April 24

Similar but different to Factorio in all the best ways. The 3D take comes with benefits and disadvantages, but the addictive building qualities are still there. The game is beautiful and runs very well for early access, but the game is early access so there are occassional concerns, but they have been very infrequent and nothing that has ruined game play experience for me thus far.

I'm one of those who found this game and thought it looked interesting but could not understand how it could be a fun premise. You just build a base, right? And then grind through tech trees by making stuff. Yes, but somehow, like Factorio, this game calls to your inner completionist self. Developing your own solution to making an efficient production line is so inviting and addictive, and clearly there are plenty out there who agree based on the player numbers of games like this, Factorio and Dyson Sphere Project (which is now on my short list of games to try next).

It's calming and satisfying at the same time. There are elements that are not smooth and I would like to see improved, such as building in 3rd person to make placement easier, and being able to automate or queue self crafting commands (or create tech to speed it up). And the logistics of belts is either not completely refined, or I may have missed some of the more advanced commands, but again they are still developing the game.

So far, the Dev rollout plan has been slow but methodical, and the updates contain large additions to content, they are hitting all the right ideas to add, so I think this game is on the right track. If it looks interesting, it's probably right up your alley.",Recommended,1381,43.5 hrs on record,Posted: April 24

Great game! I was hesitant to buy but I can say its worth the money. Something special about this game is that you never feel at a loss for what to do which I find common in other games once you've gotten to the end of your ideas at that time. Rather, I feel like I'm always behind trying to unlock the next piece of equipment before I unlock the one I have tasked. Mechanics are quite good especially with early access. (22 hours in and no remarkable bugs).

base building: I am the person that can only decide on the set up I want after placing it down and deleting it 100 times until it looks and flows just right... this game reduces all the time consuming monotony of breaking down a huge setup just to move it a few meters. The ability to resorb items and place them down instantaneously makes a huge difference (plus you don't lose you resources by doing it)",Recommended,720,21.9 hrs on record,Posted: April 24

This is a ""AAA"" title in the factory/automation world.

From building snaps, to multiple pathing styles for conveyors. This one takes everything Fcatorio started and kicks it up 3 notches, in FPS view!

Minimal xeno presence, and cute arachnophobia mode put this solidly in the exploration/build genre with no defense or fortification elements to worry about.",Recommended,324,142.3 hrs on record,Posted: April 24

A most satisfying experience.

First of all, this game is very relaxing. You are not pressured in time, only in ressources that have to be found and exploited. You do it all on your own terms, no pressure for progression but your own. The only danger is the wildlife, but once you get some equipment and get the feel of it, it's not hard to deal with.

Basically, it's all about organization. You don't have to juggle with thermodynamic or fluid mechanics, only with extraction and transformation.

That being said, the game has many production lines who will merge into other production lines to keep you busy redesigning everything to your taste or you just deal with it and watch your conveyor spaghetti mess rise off the ground.

You start with just a miner and, soon enough, end up with a mutli level factory with kilometres of conveyor belts going in every directions. Fun to plan or just wing it.

As of update 4, it feels almost like a finished game: it's stable and has enough quality content to keep you busy for a while.

If you like those kind of games, this one might be a must have. For the pricing, tons of other games fall very short, but this one delivers.

Then you can enjoy your cup of joe.

This game is at the crossroads between Minecraft, Factorio and No Man's Sky.

I have 4 distant factories out in the woods operating on their own and filling my base with precious goods through automated delivery truck routes. Those goods are being funneled into 3 separate local factories and becoming even more precious goods. I use those to venture out and make even more advanced remote facilities.

Every little effort I make in this game pays off immensely; the bigger my machine grows, the easier it is to move forward; and yet there's always something even bigger around the corner, driving me to get just a little bit more of this, a little bit more of that.

Satisfactory is a fantastically complex factory builder on the surface that ultimately feels empty and directionless as it fails to actually provide any motivation for building said factories in the first place. It's aimless and meandering, and apparently the reason to build is building itself.

Granted the game is in Early Access (has been for a very long time) and this very likely may change in the future - until then, I am only giving it a negative review because if the game were to stay in it's current state, it wouldn't be a very fulfilling or fun game. It lacks goals.

That said, the actual process of building factories is incredibly deep and well thought out, and continues to get better.

When the developer adds an actual purpose to all this building, I will change my review from negative to positive.",Not Recommended,699,22.8 hrs on record,Posted: April 23

Bought it after I bought a different game very much like this one but the minute I bought it for my son watched him play it and had to buy it for myself we have played it all night all day with very little sleep its so addictive you just wanna see what you can play with next in the equipment and what it does I have NEVER said that I love a game so much as this one its NOT boring! The Best I have Played in many years of gaming! We play together and hardly any bugs so far might get stuck once in a while lol! Highly recommenced if ya like staying busy. And for those of you that do or do not like fighting there are bad dogs to fight ! But not to hard to kill but do kill you!",Recommended,579,50.3 hrs on record,Posted: April 23

This game is addictive & everything about it is so good. Given, there are some bugs here and there but that's to expect from a game that is still in early access but i have yet to encounter any game breaking bug. Also, since its still in early access its kind of crazy to think that the devs will be adding more content into the game!

As far as the game goes, graphics are awesome, all the various machines look great as well as their satisfying animations & the conveyor belts just hit different.

Amazing game, put many hours into. I'm no engineer, but it still attracted to this amazing game full of super fluid automation. 10/10
Graphics are really pretty, with a well designed world, UI is easy to navigate. Monsters can still be a challenge to deal with in the later stages, but don't impact gameplay hardly at all. Progress is basically player driven, and learn things by trying them out yourself. this makes improving in this game feel real and really makes you excited when you learn new techniques to improve automation.
For new players, Space is key to making big factories. lay concrete platforms and walls to plan for massive expansion always. Multi-floor factories are generally the way to go.",Recommended,609,179.4 hrs on record,Posted: April 23

The only thing to dislike about this game is your CPU. It can get pretty intensive after 80+ hours and monster size buildings, It has been well omptimized.

Note: I hardly ever review games, but this game is great and deserves a review.

This game is absolutely amazing. It's in early access, so there will be bugs. However, so far, I have not discovered a single bug while playing this game. This game runs great, looks amazing, and works extremely well. I cannot recommend this enough. This is one of those games where, even if this type of game isn't for you, you cannot ignore the amount of work put into it. This game is a masterpiece.

What I like:
-------------
Floors can be built inside and overlap each other
Multiple hotbar levels, 10 spots in each level, 10 levels (can have more with upgrades, i think)
Mostly a building game, but the combat and exploration are amazing as well
There's so much in this game. This turns into that which turns into 9 other things which each turn into something else.
Automation go brrrrrr
Ridiculously huge maps to explore
Multiple map types (desert, flats, snow)

What I don't like:
-------------------
nothing. seriously, after sitting here for about 5 minutes thinking about what's wrong with this game, I cannot find a single bad thing about it.

Extremely great game. Never thought I'd enjoy a game like this (I'm a pvp type of guy. Rust, tarkov, ya know, those games).

Is it worth a buy? Yes. Buy it now, even if it's not on sale. This game is worth every penny of it's full price.",Recommended,1163,73.9 hrs on record,Posted: April 22

I can say without a doubt that this game that this game lives up to its title, its really satisfying to be able to create whatever type a factory you want, big, small, tall, wide, you name it, you can do it. I also believe that its quite fun to play with others and I would actually promote to do. Almost all of my time in this game so far has been with a friend. The price of 30 bucks may seem steep at first but I'll assure you that this game with get quite addictive and be worth the money in the long run.",Recommended,423,37.1 hrs on record,Posted: April 22

2.5 years after getting that fat epic paycheck, game is still very much unfinished. A lot of in-game objects marked as WIP (work in progress). My base spawned next to deadly alien structures, that according to wiki cannot be touched for now, even in the end-game.
Building clipping is out of this planet. You can build splitters/mergers inside of buildings, which means you'll be unable to connect belt to them. Belts however, can easily go through each other.
No build assist mode - you play as regular sized human and you place building 3x your height with no way of seeing behind them. This causes you to rebuild 3-4 times before you finally line up input with output properly.

The overwhelmingly positive reviews speaks for itself.

A 3D Factorio game with no clipping conveyor belts and lots and lots of fuel to spend 😅 (9 overclocked fuel power generators aren't enough for all that fuel) and a heavy plastic deficiency.

Solwra,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Solwra/,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
I enjoy playing sandbox games quite a lot and satisfactory falls under that same category. I will put this out at the start of this review, I do enjoy this game whenever I play it, I think that there are a lot of things this game does well and every new update there is a plethora of things to explore and the polish of those features seem pretty decent for an early access game.

With that being said, I cannot recommend this game due to how boring it gets very quickly.

The game has very shallow depth for a game that it wants to be. Sandbox games usually allow you to build on your own level of depth you want the game to have, however the clear lack of tools and building options to do so it comes as no surprise that you can only arrange the same foundations a couple of times till you become bored of doing so. There is only 1 map and no map editor for community to create it's own maps, in my opinion a game like this should natively support some kind of editor tool to allow you to create your own maps, have some kind of expansion past the initial map or generate a random map every game, that way no game feels ever the same. On top of it, the progression system is very linear, with an attempt at creating a tech tree through MAM it still does not give you any options to go past, something I'd like to see is some kind of missions to complete rather than following the same format that milestone system follows.

I know this may came off a bit as harsh, however I really hope I can change this review as the time goes on and wish that the game keeps improving and keeps filling a lot of the void there is in the game.",Not Recommended,1332,177.5 hrs on record,Posted: April 22

Incredibly well designed. The way you make new components and upgrade your Space Elevator to unlock new and better materials is amazing. This game takes a lot of patience though, and there are a lot of portions in the game where you have to manage your resources well or otherwise risk slowing progress down. This is a good thing in my opinion though, because it rewards players that are aware of what needs to be refilled and what needs to be created at the same time.

Wow this game is hyper addictive. I am only up to Tier 4 at the moment and it literally is a bottomless pit of logic puzzles and figuring out how to maximize efficiency. You can expect to have the 'recipes' get more complex as you progress so keep that in mind when building (you will likely want to expand at some point). There are some user interface bugs (you will need to figure out trucks/truck depots with trial and error, no tutorial or UI hints) but the game play is smooth as butter for early access. Once you have a working factory it is extremely satisfying and I often catch myself just watching the factory in action and seeing the parts come off the line.

Satisfactory isn't a game. Satisfactory is an addiction. Of all the crafting games I've played, none have blended enjoyment, management, discovery, and beauty as well as this. Typically, this genre tends to overwhelm with a lack of guidance, and an over reliance on tedium. Satisfactory is vast (probably way more than I'm anticipating having only played for 10 hours at the time of this recommendation) and there are tedious elements, but the systems allow you to go at your own pace. There aren't (to my knowledge) bad guys that come out at night and ruthlessly destroy all you've been working on. Satisfactory is about efficiency, and the continuous nagging thought of ""how can I be manufacturing this stuff quicker and easier? How can I make this automation work for me?"" Yeah. It's a great game, and the complexity of the systems really make you think. There doesn't seem to be a true failure state. Machines don't break down, you don't have to keep your engineer fed or watered, deconstruction of a structure doesn't hurt you or leave you resource-less; it's simply a race against yourself. Maybe this all changes the deeper into the game you get, but after 10 hours, I can't recommend Satisfactory enough. Try it! Even if you're someone like me that tends to be overwhelmed and annoyed by other games in the genre.",Recommended,1114,18.1 hrs on record,Posted: April 21

Conclusion: The game is good but wait because of possible technical difficulties (crashes, delay on client side).

Functionally speaking the game is good. It is obviously like factory and if you liked that game but you can stomach a little more chaos, then this a good game for you.

I would not recommend this game at this moment because of sometimes unplayable delay on client side and CONSTANT (every session) crashes, ending with the unreal crash reporter and it necessitating a restart of the PC in most cases. It can even cause other games not to start anymore.

If that does not happen on your system, then great and more power to you. I am sure you will get the price worth of game out of this one. Yet, for me this game left a sour taste in my mouth.

I think it would be bold to hide behind ""early access"" after such a long development time when it comes to such general technical issues, so whether you think this will be better in the future is up to you.",Not Recommended,810,125.8 hrs on record,Posted: April 21

This game's awesome. The choices you make when designing your factory impact how you'll be interacting with the world and what challenges you'll face moving forward. Many transportation options and building blocks allow you to customize your factory in interesting and expressive ways. This means that even for long-distance operations, you don't necessarily need to use the same solution every time and you can get really creative with how you choose to play. The world is sweet and just keeps going. There are many biomes and the use of verticality and scale is pretty magnificent. The atmosphere of the game is nice, the UI and all the factory blocks are pretty once you get used to the scale of them. The exploration aspect of the game rewards you for looking around while the combat and environmental hazards add stakes to the experience.

Building a factory in this game is about more than making things: it's about how you choose to interact with the world to succeed, and there are no wrong answers.",Recommended,855,178.4 hrs on record,Posted: April 21

This game is excellent and I look forward to its completion. I am hoping for more survival mechanics. Perhaps an optional mode of play where you actually have to struggle to survive, Coffee Stain did Sanctum 1+2 so I know they can implement more mayhem properly. The cool thing is...they could really do almost anything they want with this-take in almost any direction. Really looking forward to seeing it progress.

First of all, you must approve the data collection agreement before you can play the game. Otherwise, you cannot play. This is forbidden if you only want to play the game. You must consent to data collection about you for the game you purchased. For this reason, it deserved to get a negative vote.

Negative features:
1. There is no goal in the game. There is nothing but technological progress and production. In Factorio, you can fight with alien creatures that are constantly getting stronger and spread on the planet and you can have fun by producing different war vehicles.

2. Weapon types are very bad and inadequate.

3.No heavy weapons (tanks, helicopters, planes, artillery)

4. No active server creation. You can only work with an invitation. Don't buy if you dream of big servers. You cannot set up a professional server or connect because it is not available. In short, the game is single player.

5. The map is not unlimited. It will take a very large island limited.

6. Ridiculous: The resources are endless. This is not realistic, just like a children's game. It should have been a game about running out of resources and researching the environment for different resources.

7. The number of scientific researches is extremely low.

8. There are no blueprints for building duplication and setting up huge facilities. You have to do everything one by one or install mods.

9. So:
Factorio = Protein / Satisfactory = Fructose syrup
Factorio = Sun / Satisfactory = Moon
Factorio = Thorium / Satisfactory = Calcium
Factorio = Strong state / Satisfactory = Village

You have a long way to go.

I love this game, and this is why.

I've spent a lot of my life gaming and this game stands out to me on so many levels. The reason for this, I think, is the wide range of talents of the people responsible for creating it. You can be smart without being particularly talented, you can be talented without being particularly creative, you can be creative without being funny. To be all of those, and have enough empathy, care and insight to place the player in the center, is incredibly rare. This is what this game does, it embodies all of that. You feel it when you play. It's full of jokes, mindboggling landscapes, otherworldly plants, creatures and structures.

So much of the game industry is about tricking players into playing games that aren't that fun. They do it by psychological tricks, by creating habits (offering daily and random rewards, each having their own psychological hook) and sure, they have players. But are the players happy while playing the game? Most producers don't seem to care. The creators of this game do, and it shows. Every gorgeous landscape, every joke, every little treasurehunt is an adventure with the player in focus. The game is created with love and with joy and you can just feel it when you play. You pick one bacon agaric plant next to some mountain and then you see another one, following the trail of baconcrumbs into a cavernous miniadventure. There are hundreds, maybe thousands of these all over the map. It makes me feel like it's the person that is valued, not the purse. I feel like my experience is key to everything the creators put in and I'm not used to that. It's a wonderful feeling.",Recommended,1372,"1,074.3 hrs on record",Posted: April 21

Great game and well worth it if you're willing to put in the time and effort of grinding and gathering to make a fully automated and satisfying system.......BUT......Y'all forgot to tell me there were damn spiders in this game! I have severe arachnophobia so when i heard distant hissing coming from the bushes while exploring (this game is a LOT bigger than it seems and you can go literally anywhere you can see) Out pops three big ass spiders and come charging at me while I was playing at 2AM in the dark.....Let's just say I screamed and got up after I frantically killed all three while shaking and paced around my room saying not nice things while uncontrollably twitching and looking around for anything that might hurt me.

This game is one of my favorites for sure. The sense of discovery is quite magical; and the pacing and balance of the game feels very rewarding. Plus the lizard doggos are the cutest, not to mention the little factory cart (which is even more silly because it is incredibly hard to drive)!

I find the world charming, the way you are treated by your faceless superiors is comparable to how people are treated in The Outer Worlds. The art is vivid and absolutely gorgeous, especially in the ""easier"" desert. Something i found interesting is that it is just one big map, and picking before you start is simply deciding how much you want to struggle in the beginning/ where you want to be located. If you like Minecraft, you will absolutely adore this game for sure; it scratches a similar itch, but more focused in its goals.

The fauna in this game are interesting to me, i mentioned the ""lizard doggo"" before, but there is also a land whale that walks on stilted legs, and if you step on it, it is bouncy like a jump pad. There are also fire spitting rhinos and boars that headbutt you, as well as fireflies the size of volleyballs, and jumping spiders that can be replaced with cute cat heads, with arachnophobia mode on. There is very little to say negatively about this game to be honest. My only ""problem"" with this game (not really a problem) is that when you are playing multiplayer, if your partner quits, their body just stands there idly wherever they were when they quit; the same thing happens every update too where you respawn and it leaves a random character wherever you were standing when you last saved. Though i am pretty sure they fixed that.",Recommended,1382,111.1 hrs on record,Posted: April 20

To say this game is incredibly well-balanced would be a pretty large understatement.

In general, the art style, music, and humor are EXACTLY what I wanted in this masterpiece without having any expectations to begin with. The world feels rich and pulls me to explore even though there's comparatively less content than in many open world games. Sometimes I'll see a resource like 5000m away and make a plan to connect it to my factory just because I know I'll have a lot of fun figuring out how any one of 10 ways I want to do it.

The moment I knew I was hooked was when I was about 15ish hours in and suddenly my power went out while adding to my copper refinery group. Got some fuel for the reserve biomass burners, flipped the switch, then boom, off again? Ohhh, I added too many power draws, let's make a few more burners! But wait, now my factory lost synchronization because the coal going to the hydro generators was being pulled from 2000m away, so now I can't get enough power to run the extractors to get the coal! Let's add a container in-line to store the coal and act as a capacitor for when I get it going again. Meanwhile, I set up 5 burners on a separate circuit to power the coal extractors and some other basic functions, now I need lots of biofuel! That should work! OH WAIT, I'M OUT OF BIOFUEL. Let's go ""borrow"" some alien carapaces to get a quick jump. Ok, got that, split the fuel between the burners, coal is now being pulled in for the hydro generators.

You really have to keep an eye on things, the game is SO engaging and makes you plan ahead as best you can, only to realize every time you add something that you need to re-configure a preexisting group of machines to work better with your modifications, or you need more of a certain resource since you started more advanced production, or you need to travel thousands of meters just to get the one oil resource within a 10min drive, or you need to venture out to find new technology in the wilderness, or any of a hundred other aspects to manage. I can't wait to start all over again when the full game releases.",Recommended,1727,101.1 hrs on record,Posted: April 20

Absolutely incredible! This game helps me a ton with stress and it is just so relaxing trying to find the correct amount of ore that needs to go into each crafter and so on. It is also an open world game so you can do whatever you want without the fear of running out of room. It has amazing graphics, the community is great, the game is so entertaining with even me still learning more about the game every day! It is constantly getting updates and even in its early access release it is my #1 favorite game! Just the satisfaction of unlocking that new recipe or completing a new wing to your factory is fun and accomplishing.

Survival/craft spin:
Heavy focus on building and automation of manufactured goods.
Very light combat, exploration, narrative and goals.

Seemingly endless possibilities for base expansion and complexity could potentially provide many gameplay hours.

Runs surprisingly well considering all the complex structures that start adding up.

My only concern is lack of content and incentive to build elaborate bases. As with any crafting game, you will eventually question the time investment and tedium.

I think if it had a clear and defined goal and endgame, it would have more staying power. I'm struggling to justify 100s of hours to streamline everything without any kind of payoff.
I just simply can't click for hoyrs on emd without a carrot to chase.

Very fun. No real penalty other than ""downtime"" so there's no real pressure to get out of your comfort zone too quickly. The exploration is fun, resources don't seem too stingy so it's not like you're forced out into a world too quickly. A few unique weapons make the aliens not that difficult but be careful around cliffs. The knockback some have is nasty and can send you flying with a ton of time to think about it before you die. Very fun game once the mechanics start to click. Open world base builder factory stuff and it feels so good to see those items zipping along the belts! The youtube community is great too, there are a few dudes doing really good guides and builds to get you looking at things in a different light. Very fun game!

I have barely scratched the surface, but I think this game is already in my top 10 all time list. The amount of satisfying progression and the wonderful interpretation of seeing your own factory in action is something that only Tekkit classic could replicate, and Satisfactory excels even beyond that. Fun game play, thought-provoking mechanics, and creating your own world while encouraging exploration make this game one of the best I have ever played.

This game is amazing. If you're a fan of open world, survival, crafting, and idle games this game is perfect. One of my biggest issues with this genre of games is inventory management, redundant crafting of older recipes, and continually having to harvest resource. Since the focus of this game is automation mining can be done automatically, crafting can be done automatically, and conveyor belts move the items to a storage contain. You still have to manage your ever expanding personal inventory but it's so much less daunting. The survival aspect isn't overly challenging but if you go too far things will kill you if you don't have decent weapons. Not having my infrastructure damaged by time or monsters is also so nice. I don't want to play a constant repair game. Once you've stabilized power you can treat this game like an idle game and leave it running to continue crafting. To progress in the game you'll need to export the wilds for new resources and it's a really good balance. I really hope future update do not ruin the great balance this game currently has.",Recommended,906,287.5 hrs on record,Posted: April 20

First of all this is a great game!

At the first try i could walk ingame but not look around. Took some time and several tries to fix the problem via .exe file-properties. So i started a world, built a first factory, then update 4 came. I wasnt surprised to see my save game was gone and i had to start over but the mouse was stuck again. Same problem, the way i fixed it before didnt fix it now, it took 2 evenings of frustration till i got it to work. OK i started a new world, better planned then first time, played some hours, got coal working, then random small update appears... mouse stuck AGAIN... several days later i solved the problem... getting rid of anti virus solved it xD

I'm a man of open worlds and sandboxes so combining the two, especially when strategy is involved makes this game very addicting and fun to play.

superferry53,https://steamcommunity.com/id/superferry53/,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Despite being in Early Access, this game offers a really nice looking world where you conduct research, gather resources and design supply lines to improve your systems. It has a lot of potential, and it feels in the sweet spot where you needn't have a PhD in Logistics to make a decent production chain, but it isn't a braindead grinding simulator. If you enjoyed games like Space Engineers, Factorio and the likes you will get instantly hooked to it.

The thing that surprised me the most and made me felt that most other games lack is an Arachnophobia mode, which prevents me from screaming and throwing my headphones away every single time a spider comes to give me a hug. It might be a minor detail, but the devs really hit the nail on these small things.",Recommended,643,68.7 hrs on record,Posted: April 20

Great game, I can't wait to see the final product. I spent so much time tuning my machines and making sure that everything runs smoothly. And I still can think of so many ways to change it up because I want it to look cleaner.

The game so far isn't bad. Graphics are decent, audio needs more work, the complication is really awesome, but there is not enough actual independent building and some mechanics feel backwards. You don't get the floor or walls until the HUB is past level 0. Personally, I would like the walls and floors before then so I can plan my building and not have to redo a ton of things. I wished the building mechanic was more in line with Space Engineers where you have to build everything piece by piece. Feels like there isn't enough of a threat either. But, it's fun.

For Early Access this game is very impressive. Sometimes it's polished enough that it's easy to forget that it's EA and you try to build a working train station and within hours wish very bad things on basically everyone in the known universe, having sent 3 months salary directly to the swear jar while making notes of words and phrases you will have to try and explain to your children in a way that will not terrify them or scar them for life. Or you could play the game in its entirety without using any train mechanics and you'll be a happier and less mentally anguished person for it.",Recommended,500,355.6 hrs on record,Posted: April 20

Since the release of Update 4, the color pallet seems to have shifted. Now the colors seem to be darker/warmer, and now I can't play the game for more than 5 minutes without getting a headache. I was curious if it was just me, but after asking several friends about this, they all are experiencing it as well. I'm not sure if this is something the developers are aware of, but until then I won't be playing anymore. I also lost a save of 50+ hours after the update, not too happy about that either. The game was fun and addicting, but once you reach around tier 5 or 6 the game just seems tedious and repetitive. It pains me to give this game a bad review, because it is beautiful and fun, but as of right now the cons outweigh the pros.",Not Recommended,613,205.1 hrs on record,Posted: April 20

The most addicting game I have ever played in my life. Losing hours of sleep and time was something I thought would never come back like when I was younger. I remember the first time I played Command and Conquer and playing all the way through the night. Or that time I was introduced to Civilization and realized one more turn actually lasted till dawn. Since then, I have played a lot of games. I love all types of games.

This game is some other animal. It is strategy, progression and a sense of accomplishment that many games cannot master. It is fun beyond belief. When I saw the trailer, I had no idea how conveyor belts could be exciting. Then the game launches, then you start to play, and then hours of time disappear.

I introduced my friend to this, and he started and now cannot stop as well. We stopped playing Valheim (another great game) since this enter our lives. We played multiplayer, which is a lot of fun to do this game as two.

Look, this is a great game. This is well thought out and so unique. Fantastic and well worth the time and money. The fact that this is not complete adds even more excitement to the coming content of this game and I have barely cracked it.

Life is short, but this game is worth your time in life.",Recommended,1036,43.9 hrs on record,Posted: April 19

- Game runs really smooth with really good fps
- Lots of gameplay although it can be repetitive
- Controls are great and looking up some tips/tricks will teach you more that arent mentioned in the game

Not usually my type of game. It took a few short play sessions to get into it, due to my brain overheating trying to set up efficient factories. Having long conveyors from ore nodes to more centralized locations really help, it seems not worth it at first but you only have to build it once. Then you tear it all down and build it better, rinse and repeat. Lots to upgrade and research, huge maps, chill overall. If you like making things efficient, and don't mind flexing your brain a bit this game can be fun. Although you have to be in the mood for it.",Recommended,637,87.7 hrs on record,Posted: April 19

This is one of the most addictive games i have ever played.. Just the loop of get resources automate those unlock more and automate those. My only complaint is that it is very slow at the start with biomass fuel a recommendation is a way to automate power with quartz at the start of the game because, its always a very protected node and is always in dangerous spots so it would make sense to get a start of game boost if you can find a node of quartz.",Recommended,383,240.5 hrs on record,Posted: April 19

Satisfactory is an amazing hit game for me. It for sure has that Factorio feel, but also grabs that Modded Minecraft Industrial feel as well. I'm not always the best at it, but you can build extremely high vertically. The world map is insane as well. Many people when they first started this game they use to think that there was 3 maps (3 starting area's before the desert update) because of how big it is for a game like this. Now there is 4 wonderful start area's and tons of fun.

I can't wait for Dedicated Servers and I really really hope they will consider allowing team / separate progression.

If you enjoyed Modded Tech Minecraft, Factorio, FortressCraft Evolved, Dyson Sphere Program, and Many others I think you will love Satisfactory!",Recommended,636,338.2 hrs on record,Posted: April 19

It is stunning to see how far Satisfactory has come over the years. And it will go further.

The game does many things very well.

Building in Satisfactory just WORKS. Everything fits together nicely, which is really great because I get kinda OCD. I have had no small amount of headaches when building in some other games, so it is really a Satisfying experience.

You can tear down everything at no penalty (you get back the full amount of resources you used to build), which is really great when you're experimenting new ideas or just trying to get things in the right position.

And you have full control over the way you want to build your factory; spaghetti, organised, or somewhere in between.

It also gives me a great, yet perhaps slightly strange, sense of pleasure to run around sliding under conveyor belts. IT COMPLETES ME.

------------------------------------------------------------

I love how calming and peaceful the game is because I can chill for hours on end, building my factory and optimising production lines and layouts.
Not having this imminent danger at the back of my head that hordes of creatures are approaching to destroy my hard work.

Yet, that doesn't mean there isn't any combat. In fact, conflict with the fauna (and flora...?) can get rather intense while you're out and about. Rest assured, there are really neat weapons and equipment.

Exploring is also a huge part of the game, which is why it's so awesome to have a breathtaking world with many biomes to be in awe of while exploring the expansive map (30 square kilometres).

------------------------------------------------------------

Side progression content, like research trees, adds more layers to an already immensely deep game.
I'm always unlocking new stuff, like parts that can be used to make my factory look even cleaner and more Satisfying.

I really appreciate the details in the game as well.
The animations are so magnificent (like the Space Elevator's, for one) and the sound effects are very fitting.
Building and item designs look great and the music is very relaxing.

You can't really see your own character at this point, especially in single player, but I know a lot of work has gone into the character design and I wish we could appreciate it more.

------------------------------------------------------------

There's a whole ton of content and features yet to come, and bugs to be fixed, but Coffee Stain is passionately working on the game.

They are such a chill group of devs, and I love watching their Youtube channel because you can see how real they are, and learn about how they make the game (especially from the Developer Highlights).
It is also rare to see Community Managers that are as engaged as Jace and Snutt are.

This game lives up to the name. The attention to detail is absolutely great from animations to machines and vehicles. The devs are also some of the coolest wholesome ones I've seen in while, putting on live streams to hype new updates and putting together amazing trailers to go with. Now if you aren't much into build things to build better things then this might not be for you but oh boy does it get intense late game. It basically becomes a puzzle of your own creation and the tools you unlock help you move around your maze of a factory. Would be cool to see a setting or game mode where you can get raided because the only real threat you have to face is the wild life whenever you expand but there is a modding community with lots to add and hopefully more to come. infinite/10 can't wait to see what 1.0 will be like",Recommended,686,162.4 hrs on record,Posted: April 19

The first hour I played I was like ""Oh this is kinda neat"". I had tried Factorio before and bounced off, my head struggled to focus on learning how to build and managing the RTS aspects at the same time, so I thought maybe the same would happen here. I was wrong, and I've now been sucked in completely.

It's ... satisfactory (pun intended).

Game initially has a very ARK and Subnautica feel to it - you're on your own (you against the world), running around and slowly grabbing every resource you can by hand. Then you start unlocking various tiers of tools and mechanisms to upscale and automate this process to be able to unlock further tiers with better tools and mechanisms, Graphics are beautiful. The game doesn't hold your hand and doesn't spoonfeed you how to build your factory - during tutorial you are taught the basics of how to use your tools and how to gather resources, the rest is up to you. That means if you don't start building your factory lines as soon as you receive the blueprints, you'll be running around for an hour forth and back manually gathering resources and processing them by hand, all the while thinking to yourself: ""there's gotta be a faster way of doing this"" - the game is called ""Satisfactory"" ... you're suppose to build automated lines not fetch everything by hand. However, if you don't like building factories or tweaking your conveyor lines... you might not enjoy this. There's a research table, which allows you to unlock stuff through exploration and research by feeding research projects components like alien animals and various plants but overall the exploration feels rather limited, because again, this is ""Satisfactory"" and not ""Exploratory"".",Recommended,1180,3.5 hrs on record,Posted: April 19

I saw some complaints regarding the multiplayer connectivity on this game that I want to address before the rest of my review, for those of you who only enjoy this kind of game with friends:

Although I have only played 3 relatively short sessions with the same person so far, I can report that the only bugs/issues encountered on either side were general desync, such as the joiner initially having bushes/trees that appear harvest-able but are no longer on the map for the host. This however resolved itself quickly upon leaving the vicinity of the 'ghost assets' and returning, which removes those assets. Apart from this, the joiner will find it slightly more difficult to hit enemies due to split-second delays in attacks compared to the host. Bearing in mind that the devs have a disclaimer on the Multiplayer saying that it is buggier than Solo, I would say that the online is functioning very well. (My issues were observed on a long distance connection between Eastern US and Southern Africa)

Moving on to the rest of the game, this is a real gem. I've spent just as much time crafting, building, optimising and completing missions as I have spent exploring, admiring the scenery and watching my machinery and production lines work. This game is not only entertaining and well developed, but also just plain satisfying, as the name itself implies (as well as the endless ""this game is Satisfactory"" jokes I've made to my partner).

There is never any time pressure. Its up to you what you want to do and when you want to do it. Even the how is almost 100% up to you and your vision.

To go into detail would make this review way too long. If you are at all interested in the concepts of Industry & Production and building fabrication plants exactly the way you want, get this game without hesitation.",Recommended,1515,55.7 hrs on record,Posted: April 19

Satisfactory Review

This is a great game! I really enjoy it, the tutorial is very easy to follow which is nice.
When you progress in the game, it becomes harder every tier you go up and you really have to plan your factory.

There are a few things that I personally would like to see in the future like:
- Maintenance on buildings
- Random mob spawns (they now spawn in fixed places)
- Make it so mobs can actually do damage to your buildings
- Probably some more but can't think of any right now

I really have a lot of stutters (1-3 seconds) while having 90+fps. That is really frustating, but the game is still in early acces so that will probably be fixed in the future.",Recommended,573,43.4 hrs on record,Posted: April 19

So I think it's only fair that I revisit this since I have since put in another 90 hours since my first review (and I think I'm addicted). I must admit I judged too soon and I have left my original review up for reference. If you want the short answer, yes I think it's worth the purchase but read on for why.

My original problem turned out to be my own failures. The game is not easy, in fact I would say it suffers from a classic pitfall in this type of game: the learning cliff. But that said I wouldn't change it, because I hate games that hold your hand too much. In fact in retrospect this game does a great job to hold your hand just enough to not be annoying on additional playthroughs yet still let you fail by your own stupidity.

Designing a production line is frustrating, complicated, and yet amazingly rewarding process. (prepare to ask ""where did the last 4 hours go""?). Unlocking new toys is fun as hell! Realizing you unlocked something amazing and can't build it until you go find a bunch of new stuff is super annoying (in that I get to go search for stuff and die trying way), but wait there's more!

Being chased by scary ass giant freaking spiders will probably induce nightmares (there's an arachnophobe mode which changes the sprites, thanks devs but I like my adrenaline injections)! You will learn the sounds of some mobs and reflexively jump to avoid their attack. Oh and even though it doesn't kill stuff there is no end to the fun of running over above mentioned mobs with your dune buggy thing. Yes I have parked the vehicle on top of them to keep them from attacking me, this is a viable tactic.

Ultimately I would say buy the game if you have $25 to spend (at time of writing) and love these types of crafting exploring games. But do be aware that there are bugs, some of them can be fun, others annoying. However I haven't seen a truly game breaking bug yet, so for early access at this price point it's a great game so far.

P.S. If you're like me and struggling, go find the wiki and an online map to help you out. It may feel a bit like cheating but even on my second play through I am finding the wiki very helpful!


Original Review:

Honestly I wanted to love this game. And on a level I do love it, which is why it pains me to say no right now. Ultimately I love this type of builder game, I loved Factorio for example, however I hated resource depletion in that game. I had thought maybe this game turned it into 3d and ditched that, which it did. BUT, the problem is power generation. There are no other depletion mechanics but after a short period I found myself constantly maintaining power generators. I want to love this game, and on a level I do, but I also want this game to be more of a sandbox than it is. It is for this reason that I at this moment I can't so solidly ""yes buy it"". I do hope given the early access status that the game will catch up.",Recommended,2374,171.3 hrs on record,Posted: April 18

TLDR: A generally chill, graphics card breaking, factory builder on a beautiful alien world with satisfyingly tight mechanics and, that is kind of it?

LONGER: It is a 3D factory builder which has put a heavy emphasis on logistics and exploitation of resources, a secondary emphasis on exploration and a nearly non-existent emphasis on combat. Do not expect a factorio style alien assault. That being said, what it does choose to focus on, is executed superbly. Controls for building are straight forward enough, logistics setup seems fairly intuitive and the research aspect really gets you out there to explore a very beautiful and fairly varied alien landscape. The music is pretty damn good as well.

That being said, the games requirements can totally place a choke hold on your PC, depending on your settings and the combat is very rudimentary. Its very clear that it was never really the focus but, generally speaking it does not feel great so, if you are here for combat for some reason, this one wont do it for you. Its more of a grim necessity than something to revel in.

Overall, have a chill time, build some factories and, plow a wonderful natural wonder of a world into a concrete jungle of most efficient resource exploitation!",Recommended,1053,102.9 hrs on record,Posted: April 18

YOU CANNOT PAUSE THIS SINGLE-PLAYER GAME. Because ♥♥♥♥ you.

I died three times completing the very first objective. Why? The markers were WAY off from the objective and were underground. I had to go watch a video of the game to figure out what the hell to do. (The markers felt entirely uncorrelated with the objective.) Instead of refunding the game as I should have, I persisted -- seemingly because I wanted to encounter the same or similar issues ad infinitum. For people interested in having any clue as to what they should do next, this game is best described as a bookmark-the-Wiki simulator.

You advance the game by finding new items in the world. The most recent two items I found are ""WIP"" and explicitly state they don't do anything.

Let me say it again: YOU CANNOT PAUSE THIS SINGLE-PLAYER GAME.",Not Recommended,690,14.0 hrs on record,Posted: April 18

Some times later.. found copper and food to heal and limestone..if you can get those and manage to kill the more dangerous animals fast enough then things are getting interesting..changing recommendation , but at the start in can become very hard in the false spot.",Recommended,477,23.8 hrs on record,Posted: April 18

Amazing game, but the combat is absolutely terrible. And as long as combat is a necessary part of the progression, I cannot recommend it.

Satisfactory is just epic survival / crafting based game. The amount of content in-game is just great. I am playing coop world and after 22 hours we are I would say in about 35% of the game unlocked. But that doesn't mean we are in 35% of what game has to offer.
The game mechanics are really nice and everything has its purpose.
Until now I didn't find an item without a purpose. Even green slime something can be use for research.

However, if you want to play in coop, you will experience quite large amount of bugs. Usually its like small visual bugs. But sometimes it can be quite annoying. For example host sees the storage system one way and the person joining into the session can see only half of it. This is something that can be fixed by couple of restarts but its still quite annoying. The game is in early access and if you're starting a multiplayer session it alerts you that multiplayer ""is far from finished""

Overall I would say its one of the best survival / crafting based games I played.",Recommended,843,107.4 hrs on record,Posted: April 18

We had two stacks of Iron ore, seventy-five pallets of Steel beams, five slugs of high-powered sparky power, a Tractor half-full of Quartz, and a whole galaxy of multi-colored Beryl nuts, Paleberries, Bacon agaric, Mycelia… Also, a quart of Crude oil, a quart of water, a case of Polymer resin, a pint of Heavy oil residue, and two dozen solid Biofuels. Not that we needed all that for the construction, but once you get locked into a serious workbench manufacturing, the tendency is to push it as far as you can. The only thing that really worried me was the Uranium waste. There is nothing in the world more helpless and irresponsible and depraved than a man in the depths of an Uranium waste run, and I knew we’d get into that rotten stuff pretty soon.

a few bugs like.. tractor suddenly unable to be used until dissassembled and reassembled and auto pilot system on the tractor is uh.. kinda funny to watch. We attempted to stupid proof a path for it and still didn't work. Server saves cause a little bit of lag as expected but over all its an amazing game. The AI on the monsters is surprizingly great so it makes surviving in dangerous places actually a challenge. It's hard to trap them on simple walls as they are able to figure out pathing. First night I got the game I played with a roommate and we stayed up until 5am playing it. Messed up our sleep schedule but it was worth it.

Very interesting premise and a very enjoyable automation game. Devs seem to be really dedicated to improving the game and are engaged with the community.

This game is simply delightful. I find planning out factory layouts to be very relaxing, almost meditative, and watching all the parts flow through a newly built production line is... well, satisfying. You are never pressured to build faster, or bigger, or better - it's all up to you and how you want to pace yourself. I was also pleased to find that the combat (and death) is a lot less punishing than the initial trailers made it out to be. Highly recommended if you at all like logistics, resource management sims, research trees, exploring, or just sitting idly and watching your hard work pay off.",Recommended,516,177.9 hrs on record,Posted: April 17

it starts of all simple, you make an iron smelter for iron bars, then you realize you need to turn the iron into other parts. so you add a couple of constructors, next thing you know it's been 7 hours and you no longer know how the factory works, but if it shuts down you know you wont be able to fix it, so you have to keep the factory running. but to keep the factory running you need to add more, the factory must grow, it never stops growing, you can't leave the factory because it provides for you and you provide for it, you can't escape, you can't fight it, there is only the factory and it must grow.",Recommended,506,129.0 hrs on record,Posted: April 17

The key to enjoyment in this game is in the name: satisfaction

I started off building randomly with no particular organisation, which lead to a tangled spaghetti of conveyor belts and production lines that were either backed up with goods or had no goods at all. For a while this was okay, my factory was a mess but it was MY mess. I knew where everything was and it was fun to navigate around, but when it came to progression there was the common issue of figuring out where to even start. Trying to figure out how to weave a new production chain into the mess was like trying to untangle cables at the back of a pc, or staring at a power extension cord with six other extension cords plugged in. Most of the time I would rather delete all of my conveyors and start over rather than try fixing them.

'decision paralysis' is something you may run into a lot whilst playing this. Knowing whats needed to be done but feeling crushed by the effort it will take to implement it. Looking at the production line for an Assembly Director System will be daunting for anyone, but attempting it is a lot harder with a messy system.

The only way to get through this was to start organising properly, first by creating dedicated 'highways' for stacks of conveyors, making sure they are all the same height and getting rid of diagonals and weird bends - sticking to just right angle turns and straight lines. This made it so much easier to expand, and it was to clean up my mess. Honestly, putting down the space elevator and watching the animation for the first time is great - but turning a complicated tangle of 10 different conveyors into a neat hub and seeing all the goods moving along smoothly?

Also, research the Xeno-Basher asap, do not torture yourself by sticking with the Xeno-Zapper for longer than you need to otherwise research will feel like a horrible grind.",Recommended,1551,132.5 hrs on record,Posted: April 17

Just lots of busywork. The game tries to be many things at once but only succeeding at one thing; factory building. But even then, there's better games for that. Factorio being one of them.

There's a huge world but no reason to go out and see it, there's no meaningful exploration to be had here. Just building a big messy, uncreative factory. All of which you can do in factorio and more.

Best 3D type of I don't even know what this genre would be called. Not as good as Factorio in my opinion, but it doesn't have to be, plus it's still in early access, and we have yet to see all they have to show us from this title. Easily worth 40 bucks but it goes for $30 and goes on sale for $24. Get it while it's still in early access, the price will go up when it leaves it. Overall, just like Factorio, you can sink countless hours into this. There is another game called Dyson Sphere Program a lot like the two of these games as well.

This game reminds me of programming in assembly, if you had to do so while inside a copy of Doom. All the fun of having no placement grid combined with all the fun of having a power source as one of the 3 or so things in the game which don't accept conveyor belts.

The straw that finally broke me was after clearing a cave, clearing a nearby forest, roaming around in the game for 12 hours, I have never once seen a bacon thing, which is a prerequisite for unlocking at least two recipes. Maybe if I just wander around for another 12 hours, I'll stumble upon this mythical ingredient.

I am sure the game is still progressing, and so maybe I'll check back in 6 months or something, but at this moment it's not _fun_ so I'm going back to D.S.P. which even an Early Access game without monsters is a fun _game_ and not a LARP-ing simulator

For people who already played Factorio:

Satisfactory is very fun, but it's not just a 3d version of Factorio. There is a much higher focus on exploration, intermediate product chains, and building for aesthetics and less focus on 'pure' logistics, maximizing throughput, and large scale transportation of resources. Enemies in Satisfactory also don't ever attack your base; they are only out in the world to make exploration more challenging (I personally prefer it this way). These different focuses aren't a bad thing. It just prioritizes different parts of the larger ""logistics game"" experience compared to Factorio.

If you liked Factorio for the puzzle of figuring out how to chain the different machines together to create a final product or if you liked building a cool base, you will probably like Satisfactory even more.

If you instead liked Factorio because of the logistics challenge of managing resources across the map, of connecting multiple full-throughput factories, and because of the oh-so-satisfying train mechanics, you may not find Satisfactory to be as satisfactory (see what I did there?).

It's not that Satisfactory doesn't have these mechanics, but they are either de-prioritized in the overall gameplay experience or only introduced to the player very late into the game. Trains are the clearest example of this, being available in Factorio as soon as you unlock steel and allowing you to completely change the way that you approach factory design going into the mid-game towards a more decentralized system of sub-factories with a number of advantages (and some disadvantages). Satisfactory has similar rail mechanics but they are a end-game technology that you only gain access to once you are all but done with the macro-level design of your base. You either have to explicitly plan to have trains early on, and sacrifice efficiency to work over large distances before you unlock them, or you build everything pretty close together the whole time and you never really find yourself needing trains unless you plan on building a full on late game mega base.",Recommended,1775,74.1 hrs on record,Posted: April 17

Lots of crafting and tiers to advance and unlock more. Quite addicting - and what is nice is you can walk away from the computer and let your factory do the work.

Eating food restores health if you are injured but other than that there's no need to keep eating. I enjoy this because you don't spend time grinding to stock up food and worry about losing health. Graphics are very good in my opinion. Controls are smooth and you don't lose any resources when you delete things you've built.

Overall I'd recommend the game. It's low stress and will keep you entertained for many many hours.",Recommended,660,185.6 hrs on record,Posted: April 17

Honestly, this game has blown my expectations out of the water, thrown them into a pan and deep fried them. This game is only in early access! I can't wait to see the full game. It may be a bit grindy at times, but that is only because you haven't automated enough yet.... Literally, automation is the main point of the game.

Pros:
Awesome Graphics
GUIs are pretty great, once you figure it out
Automation
Multiplayer friendly

Cons: (more like nit picking)
Still slightly buggy with multiplayer
Somethings will seem extremely unfeasible with the amount of resources you need, but automation saves the
day.

Great game. For future updates here a few thoughts

- Exploration and stronger monsters.
- Larger weapon array
- Guild wars but only when both parties accept no looting where players suddenly invade unless that option is made available separately.
- Interplanetary travel but it will be lot of effort - but worth it :)",Recommended,286,67.6 hrs on record,Posted: April 17

Multiplayer has improved significantly with Update 4. Desync issues appear to have been fixed as far as I can tell. I used to see my friend running in place (desync) but now that does not happen after this update.

Get this game, and especially if you have friends to build a factory with. Exploring the alien planet, building your factory, and reaching milestones is satisfying and the tech that you unlock is amazing.

I unlocked the Hoverpack this evening and it is so much better than the fuel-required Jetpack; at least around the factory. Hoverpack requires that you need to be near your power grid. There is still plenty to unpack in this update and I will keep playing as I've already put 80(!!!) hours into this game.",Recommended,619,84.3 hrs on record,Posted: April 17
