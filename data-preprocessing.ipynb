    "## Satisfactory Reviews - An NLP Project\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Earlier this year, I discovered a wonderful game named Satisfactory. I immediately fell in love with the concept of landing on an unknown planet, where the only goal is to use the planet's resources to build the ultimate factory. With a huge map jampacked with resouces, aliens and poisonous clouds (and lizard doggos!) - one has to locate resources, build factories, and spend an inordinate amount of time just making the process more efficient. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "*MUST INCREASE EFFICIENCY AT ALL COSTS*\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "As a data scientist (who willingly spent a ridiculous amount of time increasing the efficiency of everything), I needed to know what others had to say about this game. I built a webscraper that took in user reviews of Satisfactory from the Steam community website, and pulled around 6000 reviews from the past few months since the last major update. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "I wanted to focus on those that wrote a review, recommended (or not), the length of the review, and how long they've played the game. Using this data, we'll be able to draw insights into what are words commonly said across all reviews, and determine if the length of time played in the game affects their recommendation or not. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "My current hypothesis is thus:  \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### *Players that log at least 50 hours in the game will recommend this game to others.* \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "We'll start by pulling in all the relevant libraries first. "
