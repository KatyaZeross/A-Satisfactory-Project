The game mechanics are complex and unique yet are reasonably easy to understand for players who are new to the genre. Plenty of guides online which help with understanding game knowledge. Highly recommend a youtuber named \"Scalti\" as he has a lot of videos on early game builds and general knowledge on game mechanics which are easy to understand. Although the game is restricted to a set map, it has various areas which will benefit different players at different levels. \n\nIn terms of difficulty, it's pretty chill as the game doesn't force you to progress with any questlines or storylines, which there aren't, so you can take it at your own pace. \n\nHas high replayability potential as the your first run would most likely be discovering the game and its map, whereas your future runs will be fully optimising your builds. There's also large community that provide mods which I highly recommend trying out as well, maybe on your 3rd or 4th run as it'll make it just 100 times better. \n\nBe cautious though, as gameplay might be a bit physically nauseating for some people because of the player and camera movement. If you get nauseous playing Portal or Minecraft, maybe look at some gameplay and see how you feel. \n\n10/10 definitely recommend for players who are interested in getting into factory building games.", "timestamp_created": 1628395442, "timestamp_updated": 1628395442, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "97142453": {"recommendationid": "97142453", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030934087", "num_games_owned": 238, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 5905, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5905, "last_played": 1624058333}, "language": "english", "review": "On steam that messes up all installs, mods, and saves, and generally is a complete mess that they have no incentive to fix.", "timestamp_created": 1628387291, "timestamp_updated": 1628387291, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.449826985597610474", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "97142433": {"recommendationid": "97142433", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972199455", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 25800, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 392, "playtime_at_review": 25800, "last_played": 1628219335}, "language": "english", "review": "I can't stop coming back to this game!\n", "timestamp_created": 1628387258, "timestamp_updated": 1628387258, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "97139644": {"recommendationid": "97139644", "author": {"steamid": "76561199109431331", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1240, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 966, "playtime_at_review": 854, "last_played": 1628460009}, "language": "english", "review": "so good", "timestamp_created": 1628383017, "timestamp_updated": 1628383017, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "97136030": {"recommendationid": "97136030", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058062508", "num_games_owned": 59, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2447, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2447, "playtime_at_review": 1729, "last_played": 1628488611}, "language": "english", "review": "fun", "timestamp_created": 1628377350, "timestamp_updated": 1628377350, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "97135904": {"recommendationid": "97135904", "author": {"steamid": "76561197980277740", "num_games_owned": 439, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 16277, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 54, "playtime_at_review": 16237, "last_played": 1628460891}, "language": "english", "review": "fun", "timestamp_created": 1628377181, "timestamp_updated": 1628377181, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "97135614": {"recommendationid": "97135614", "author": {"steamid": "76561198103795710", "num_games_owned": 140, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 4867, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1930, "playtime_at_review": 4866, "last_played": 1628377749}, "language": "english", "review": "Efficiency first, safety second.", "timestamp_created": 1628376781, "timestamp_updated": 1628376781, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521531105041503906", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "97135031": {"recommendationid": "97135031", "author": {"steamid": "76561198109766751", "num_games_owned": 131, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 8759, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1185, "playtime_at_review": 8708, "last_played": 1628378956}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun building crafting game.

Fixed world, not procedural, which is ok, though I hope in the future they will have more than one map (though like I said above...it's HUGE). Also, there are little puzzles and well guarded treasures littered around the world, and about half of them yield a really nice \"WIP\" (work in progress) reward.....love going through the trouble of exploring or clearing enemies and wasting gas mask filters to pick up a nice piece of trash that even the factory's AWESOME SINK (incinerator) will reject.\n\nDespite the cons, I absolutely love playing this.

There is no story mode, yet, so the only reason to do stuff is because you like doing stuff.\n\nSo, having gotten that out of the way, I enjoy playing it (albeit in smaller doses than many of its other fans), and recommend it to anyone who likes boots on the ground style construction sims.  However, since the focus is on building components, not building construction, the actual construction is handled by hand-wavium, and then the buildings make new parts for you.  Basically you chuck stuff out of your inventory and it turns into a new building.\nThe main point of the game, at least so, is to build intricate, efficient manufacturing systems that support further expanding said capacities.  Or creating a massive spaghetti monster of conveyor belts pipelines, and transit tubes, with the occasional out of place constructor you always forget about whenever you need more whatsits.

I highly recommend it!\n\nI'm now going to quibble about small things because that's what I do when I like a game: There seems to be a lack of biodiversity in interactable flora and fauna.  The end game seems to be almost exclusively about production lines with a lot of great ideas feeling undervalued -- Factorio's bug colonies feel like an appropriate solution, albeit taken (though manning the walls and setting up flame turrets sounds super cool in a game like this).  The multiple start zones are just different spots on the same planet and the difficulty levels are misleading (personally, the \"hardest\" ones seem the easiest and vice-versa).  Power generation feels.. clunky -- I can produce a huge facility that should double my power production but the spikes in usage and the finickiness of the water pumps take an overly large amount of effort to smooth out.  Not a whole lot of point in exploring (which gets back to great ideas feeling underused/wasted -- like, there's some really cool vehicles).

All of the resources I need are too far away, I can't passively craft things from my inventory while walking around (like I can in Factorio), power sources are very limited early on in the game, alien enemies and health regen severely limit your ability to explore for the first several hours, and on and on.  It leads to a whole lot of waiting around for things to happen, because the game puts too many obstacles in your way in the early game for you to continually automate away that tedium.

The machinery with all the amazing animations just blows my mind for some reason. I love how interactable all the machines feel and how much control over the whole experience you have. I figured 169.0 hours was a good place to stop and write a review for this amazing game that is still in early access. \n\nI have still not gotten past tier 5 because getting coal power up and running was difficult and time consuming for me. Advancing into steel and other actually complicated recipes is where I kinda got stumped with all the ratios and making sure that I'm making enough of the newest thing that I don't have to wait forever to get the to the next tier. this is where you need to start scaling up to what I find is an intimidating degree. \n\nIf I have any negatives about the game it's that the world feels really lonely there isn't a whole lot going on in the world, and I don't mean the world looks bad it's a very pretty alien planet but its pretty much just there to look at. No pollution to worry about no terrain deformation, there is some caves to explore and things to find but it just feels lacking. None of my friends own the game so I'm kind of forced to make my own fun with the game and decide on my own what to work on next. And the big bean creature's animation are a little lacking for me, it kinda folds in on itself at its joint areas and I don't like it, it just seams off compared to all the other creatures. Of witch there are 4 enemies I have come across and 4 passive creatures that I came across. apart from the spiders and lizard doggo they are kind of boring.\n\nThere is currently 8 tiers of tech in the game and I believe it will go up to 12 by full release. What they will add to those new tiers though I'm not sure as the game seems to have everything I can think of beyond some expansion to the power like some logic so I can have fun some of the stuff that currently just serves as cosmetic's. they just added drone's, zip lines, some power improvements, lights and a hand full of other things I have yet to get to.\n\nAll in all it is a great game so far a solid 8/10 for me I cant wait to spend another 169 hours just moving up two more tiers and I cant wait to see what they will add and that they will change.", "timestamp_created": 1627616396, "timestamp_updated": 1627616396, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "96608991": {"recommendationid": "96608991", "author": {"steamid": "76561198968167634", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1621, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1091, "playtime_at_review": 1062, "last_played": 1628305444}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game to play with friends but its annoying how if you have it on Epic Games you cant use that account.", "timestamp_created": 1627613763, "timestamp_updated": 1627613763, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "96607255": {"recommendationid": "96607255", "author": {"steamid": "76561198815572453", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1528, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1698, "playtime_at_review": 1129, "last_played": 1627924525}, "language": "english", "review": "10 out of ten game. super fun and what your looking for in a survival game just needs more updates and a solid story plus ending", "timestamp_created": 1627610935, "timestamp_updated": 1627610935, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "96606170": {"recommendationid": "96606170", "author": {"steamid": "76561197966631870", "num_games_owned": 51, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 3918, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 28, "playtime_at_review": 3890, "last_played": 1627829355}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game. finding resources and planning how to connect them is very fun", "timestamp_created": 1627609154, "timestamp_updated": 1627609154, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "96605296": {"recommendationid": "96605296", "author": {"steamid": "76561198404131322", "num_games_owned": 12, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1043, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1043, "last_played": 1627262430}, "language": "english", "review": "Not overwhelmingly complex.

These games generally involve a lot of math and ratios (although you technically can play without worrying about that much, as I initially did myself).  They are also known for being extremely time consuming and addictive; not in a \u201cHaha oh man I played for HOURS\u201d kind of way but more like an \u201cOh crap it\u2019s 4 in the morning and I forgot to eat dinner\u201d kind of way.\nBoth Satisfactory and Factorio also have a plethora of well done QoL features that generally put them a tier above most other games in any genre.\n\n[b]Difficulty/Learning Curve 4/5[/b] \nIf you are into this kind of a game, the learning curve is implemented very well and is quite gradual.  You slowly build up to a larger and larger scale, in a more multiplicative kind of way rather than an additive way.  However, due to some major difficulty jumps that are inevitable in this type of a game (I\u2019m looking at you, crude oil processing), I can\u2019t give it a perfect score. \nThe game also feels like it deals with by-products a lot more than its counterparts, but that is easily balanced out with the AWESOME-Sink.\n\n[b]Replayability 5/5[/b] \nOnce there is enough content available for an automation game, the replay values become insane.  Satisfactory is no exception. At the time of this review, I have 250 hours played, and that\u2019s completely vanilla and mostly singleplayer.  I could easily spend another 250+ playing modded or in a multiplayer game if I wanted to, or I could just keep scaling up the desert factory that I\u2019ve already built.\n\n[b]Visuals 4/5[/b] \nSatisfactory is very visually pleasing and is actually optimized quite well despite having so much for your GPU/CPU to load once your factory grows larger.  However, it has been in early access for a few years, so the graphics are oh-so-slightly dated (possibly a design choice to minimize demand on your PC).  \n\n[b]UI 5/5[/b] \nSatisfactory has an extremely well done UI that is easy to navigate.\nDO NOT SLEEP ON THE TO-DO LIST!! \nAlso, don\u2019t sleep on the \u201chit x\u201d feature to open up the encyclopedia.\n\n[b]Controls 4/5[/b] \nThe control set is pretty standard and will feel familiar to most gamers.  Using \u201cc\u201d to crouch/slide felt weird at first, but I got used to it, and it can always be rebound.\nThere are some minor issues with the controls, such as the hoverpack feeling like it should have a \u201cmove in the direction of the crosshair\u201d option.\nCrouch sliding constantly to go faster, however, is a very awkward mechanic. \nNo autorun WHY?? \n\n[b]Audio 4/5[/b] \nThe audio doesn\u2019t stand out as exceptional, but it also doesn\u2019t really fall short. The music is fitting and is quite nice, but isn\u2019t quite as masterful and immersive as say, Astroneer or Divinity\u2019s music.  \nThe machine audio is also really cool, and they do a good job with ADA\u2019s voice, but it\u2019s not the kind of game that I found myself turning the audio, like I did with the aforementioned games. \nI would generally be playing the game with a show or video going on in the background, so I wasn\u2019t as interested and invested in the audio or immersion in general.\n\n[b]Atmosphere 4/5[/b] \nEarly on, the game has an extremely well done atmosphere, and I would have probably given it a 5/5 if it stayed that way.\nAs you progress, you focus much more on the factory itself and feel less involved with the alien world around you.  You can always go exploring, but that is truly a minor part of the game compared to building and automation.  This brings a new kind of atmosphere: the atmosphere of the well-oiled and fine-tuned machine (or absolute spaghetti mess) that is your factory.  \n\n[b]Storyline -2/5[/b]\nUnfortunately, Satisfactory\u2019s storyline is currently very underdeveloped, but for very good reasoning.  If you start a new game and don\u2019t skip the intro, there is absolutely a story present, but it falls off heavily after that.  \nMy strong personal belief is that this is because story is an absolute bottom tier priority when it comes to automation based games.  Having a great story is a welcome addition to any game, but no one is picking up Factorio or Satisfactory and saying \u201cMan, I REALLY loved the creative story writing in that game!\u201d  They are almost always talking about the gameplay aspects such as the amazingly well done UI and QoL features, ratios, math, etc. \n\n[b]Combat/Crafting Systems 2/5, 4/5[/b]\nThe combat system is minimal and sub-par.  You get a weapon, you dodge enemy attacks if necessary, and you poke them to death. There is a nailgun, but I never really used it. \nCombat is a very low priority in a game like this, so in my honest opinion, it is slightly irrelevant when it comes to my overall impressions of the game. \nThe crafting system on the other hand is very well done.\nIt can be a little tedious at times, but this is likely a gameplay design intended to discourage hand crafting and encourage automation.  \nThe to-do list and \u201cpress x\u201d feature make it much easier to handle.\nYou cannot automate the production of buildings like you can in Factorio and Dyson Sphere Program. This is an intended gameplay design, but I\u2019m not too sure I\u2019m that big of a fan of it.  Either way, it was easy to adjust my playstyle to just having various materials on hand rather than carrying various buildings around with me.\n\n[b]Multiplayer 4/5[/b]\nMultiplayer is a ton of fun and implemented quite well, but even the devs have said it is still unfinished and unstable.  You will likely run into minor issues here and there, such as visual glitches (like the giant item glitch), desync issues, and items disappearing.  Overall it\u2019s done quite well and I\u2019ve hardly had any problems, but they do exist, so I can\u2019t give it a 5/5.  \nBe sure to adjust network quality settings to the highest possible for all players.\n\n[b]Progression/Grindiness 4/5[/b]\nThe progression system in this game feels very good, excluding a few difficulty hurdles.\nYou advance pretty steadily and you can definitely feel that advancement as you move on.\nYou advance similarly to how you build up: in a more multiplicative way than an additive way.  \nIt does start to feel a bit \u201cgrindy\u201d towards the end. Progression definitely slows down more and more as you get into the higher tiers, and it can get to be quite tedious and drawn out in the very late game.  This absolutely works for some people, and it worked for me up until the very end of the game, where I simply lost interest because I had essentially unlocked everything.\n\n[b]Humor 5/5[/b]\nYou have to look for the humor in this type of game to find it; it isn\u2019t right in your face, but similarly to Astroneer, it comes mostly from the hilarious possibilities allowed through the physics system.  There are all kinds of things you can do to propel yourself and ragdoll your character or even launch yourself into the atmosphere. \nThere are also subtle little comedic aspects presented through ADA, some of the tooltips, and the funny writings found inside the HUB. \nMost of the machines also have funny names that represent their job.\n\nDespite the non-perfect rating, I would not hesitate one bit to highly recommend this game to anyone who is interested in math, ratios, automation, production, assembly lines, and factory style games.  Even if you aren\u2019t a math person, like yours truly, you can easily adjust your playstyle accordingly and find plenty of joy in this game.  Maybe it will even help you discover a love or appreciation for numbers that you never knew was there.\n\n[url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEcvRaeIIPg&list=PLVMQqFJABF9aNm9mecHXnL5Y0AgM2vlXP&index=2]If you enjoyed this review, please consider checking out my in-depth video review
