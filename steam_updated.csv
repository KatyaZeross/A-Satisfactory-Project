9,"After the fun i have been getting with dyson sphere program which 3rd person wider angle, i also now sucked into this other ""logistics base building open world' game early access as well but i find much more my style. Mostly because it actually first person so instead of hovering above you are on the ground, the structures are above you, you have jump climb and parkour around your constructions. For early access is very clean from bugs, lots of hours of game play to do, there is early access PVE but the wildlife is no pushover. This has a very familiar ARK Survival Evolved feel to it the experience within the open world, base building, tech research is very similar but does not appear to be using the ARK engine. Even better you can co op with someone else, so work within the map build out the enviroment. I am going to be playing for sometime methinks. The game as is already worth the $$$ i reckon and there is a lot of content within the map already coded that is not yet useful or able to engage which indicates there is a lot more to come.",1,875,76.9,August 3

Still lots of fun, though the multiplayer is buggy.

i have one world with 2 separate factories run by single person, while the mother factory is run by 2.
Basically, we have the Mother factory, and the satellite states. Its a fun game.",1,263,145.3,August 3

26,"This game is in early access but the game is relaxing and you get to build cool things. The number of things you need get a little out of hand. Like to make the 500 Smart Plates for the Space Elevator took 16,000 Screws. Maybe shrink that number to half or speed up the default construction rate and lower the times you have to up the progress bar so it doesn't take so long even with automation and manual combined. The game is fantastic and I definitely recommend it.",1,399,29.5,August 3
27,"Satisfactory is incredibly satisfying for the OCD in me. Plenty of space for creativity and straight up ingenuity.

However!!!
I found the wildlife to be annoying and impractical in relation to the environment. Some have ridiculously unlimited chemical like fireballs and all of them will always attack you. Few predators will attack 100% of the time. Most will always put on a show to avoid conflict for that matter. But these ones come after you fearlessly 100% of the time. All in an effort to guard minerals or crashed drones? The AI needs serious work.

End Thought,
If you add a few smart Mods to this game, you can have hours of endless amusement. So, if you are creative and LOVE to build, but find wildlife and indestructible gas tubes to be annoying. MOD it !",1,656,354.2,August 2

29,Amazing game I saw this game for awhile and since it was 30$ I didn't know if it was for me I played gamnes like oxygen not included where you need a high problem solving skills to be good at the game but for me It's easy enough to where if I have a idea I can just get the parts or renew the parts and remake the factory destroying everything I got all the machines to just start over again and make it more effient as in making items and space efficiency I love it and if you are like me this game is for you :),1,424,36.6,August 2

128,"I don't want to just compare this game to Factorio, but I feel like I have to. In Factorio, I'm continually expanding my factory, and the way upgrades work steers me toward progressively introducing a new challenge and automating the one that I just solved. In Satisfactory, it feels like I know what I want to do, but the game is trying to stop me from having too much fun right away. All of the resources I need are too far away, I can't passively craft things from my inventory while walking around (like I can in Factorio), power sources are very limited early on in the game, alien enemies and health regen severely limit your ability to explore for the first several hours, and on and on. It leads to a whole lot of waiting around for things to happen, because the game puts too many obstacles in your way in the early game for you to continually automate away that tedium. Maybe it gets better later, or maybe the game just did an exceptionally poor job of steering me toward the right way to play the game, but the sheer act of making a factory in 3D space doesn't make up for the tedium introduced here.",0,923,31.7,July 31

189,"Coffee Stain Studios brings objects alive in a way that I just love. The machinery with all the amazing animations just blows my mind for some reason. I love how interactable all the machines feel and how much control over the whole experience you have. I figured 169.0 hours was a good place to stop and write a review for this amazing game that is still in early access.

I have still not gotten past tier 5 because getting coal power up and running was difficult and time consuming for me. Advancing into steel and other actually complicated recipes is where I kinda got stumped with all the ratios and making sure that I'm making enough of the newest thing that I don't have to wait forever to get the to the next tier. this is where you need to start scaling up to what I find is an intimidating degree.

If I have any negatives about the game it's that the world feels really lonely there isn't a whole lot going on in the world, and I don't mean the world looks bad it's a very pretty alien planet but its pretty much just there to look at. No pollution to worry about no terrain deformation, there is some caves to explore and things to find but it just feels lacking. None of my friends own the game so I'm kind of forced to make my own fun with the game and decide on my own what to work on next. And the big bean creature's animation are a little lacking for me, it kinda folds in on itself at its joint areas and I don't like it, it just seams off compared to all the other creatures. Of witch there are 4 enemies I have come across and 4 passive creatures that I came across. apart from the spiders and lizard doggo they are kind of boring.

There is currently 8 tiers of tech in the game and I believe it will go up to 12 by full release. What they will add to those new tiers though I'm not sure as the game seems to have everything I can think of beyond some expansion to the power like some logic so I can have fun some of the stuff that currently just serves as cosmetic's. they just added drone's, zip lines, some power improvements, lights and a hand full of other things I have yet to get to.

All in all it is a great game so far a solid 8/10 for me I cant wait to spend another 169 hours just moving up two more tiers and I cant wait to see what they will add and that they will change.",1,1877,170.6,July 29

It can make you very addictive as continuous improvement and rising inventory requirements always force you to grow, which is good in this game!
The discovery and the improvements that can be extracted from the wrecked wreckage can completely rewrite the production of all the factories so far. After 700+ (Epic version) hours of playing time, the development is capable of such a turnaround that it takes an additional 500 hours to rebuild.
And even ""only"" early access. What if the final improvements are included?

There is a learning curve and you can find ways to expedite many processes to speed up production. Sometimes it takes time and a *higher view*. Always keep backup storage. It's an amazing game.",1,437,64.1,July 29
229,"Overall: 4/5
Satisfactory is primarily about automation, ratios, and building, with minor elements of exploration and creative expression.

Gameplay 4/5
When committing to playing a well-done automation factory game, you first have to know what you’re getting yourself into. These games generally involve a lot of math and ratios (although you technically can play without worrying about that much, as I initially did myself). They are also known for being extremely time consuming and addictive; not in a “Haha oh man I played for HOURS” kind of way but more like an “Oh crap it’s 4 in the morning and I forgot to eat dinner” kind of way.
Both Satisfactory and Factorio also have a plethora of well done QoL features that generally put them a tier above most other games in any genre.


If you are into this kind of a game, the learning curve is implemented very well and is quite gradual. You slowly build up to a larger and larger scale, in a more multiplicative kind of way rather than an additive way. However, due to some major difficulty jumps that are inevitable in this type of a game (I’m looking at you, crude oil processing), I can’t give it a perfect score.
The game also feels like it deals with by-products a lot more than its counterparts, but that is easily balanced out with the AWESOME-Sink.


Once there is enough content available for an automation game, the replay values become insane. Satisfactory is no exception. At the time of this review, I have 250 hours played, and that’s completely vanilla and mostly singleplayer. I could easily spend another 250+ playing modded or in a multiplayer game if I wanted to, or I could just keep scaling up the desert factory that I’ve already built.


Satisfactory is very visually pleasing and is actually optimized quite well despite having so much for your GPU/CPU to load once your factory grows larger. However, it has been in early access for a few years, so the graphics are oh-so-slightly dated (possibly a design choice to minimize demand on your PC).


Satisfactory has an extremely well done UI that is easy to navigate.
DO NOT SLEEP ON THE TO-DO LIST!!
Also, don’t sleep on the “hit x” feature to open up the encyclopedia.


The control set is pretty standard and will feel familiar to most gamers. Using “c” to crouch/slide felt weird at first, but I got used to it, and it can always be rebound.
There are some minor issues with the controls, such as the hoverpack feeling like it should have a “move in the direction of the crosshair” option.
Crouch sliding constantly to go faster, however, is a very awkward mechanic.
No autorun WHY??


The audio doesn’t stand out as exceptional, but it also doesn’t really fall short. The music is fitting and is quite nice, but isn’t quite as masterful and immersive as say, Astroneer or Divinity’s music.
The machine audio is also really cool, and they do a good job with ADA’s voice, but it’s not the kind of game that I found myself turning the audio, like I did with the aforementioned games.
I would generally be playing the game with a show or video going on in the background, so I wasn’t as interested and invested in the audio or immersion in general.


Early on, the game has an extremely well done atmosphere, and I would have probably given it a 5/5 if it stayed that way.
As you progress, you focus much more on the factory itself and feel less involved with the alien world around you. You can always go exploring, but that is truly a minor part of the game compared to building and automation. This brings a new kind of atmosphere: the atmosphere of the well-oiled and fine-tuned machine (or absolute spaghetti mess) that is your factory.


Unfortunately, Satisfactory’s storyline is currently very underdeveloped, but for very good reasoning. If you start a new game and don’t skip the intro, there is absolutely a story present, but it falls off heavily after that.
My strong personal belief is that this is because story is an absolute bottom tier priority when it comes to automation based games. Having a great story is a welcome addition to any game, but no one is picking up Factorio or Satisfactory and saying “Man, I REALLY loved the creative story writing in that game!” They are almost always talking about the gameplay aspects such as the amazingly well done UI and QoL features, ratios, math, etc.


The combat system is minimal and sub-par. You get a weapon, you dodge enemy attacks if necessary, and you poke them to death. There is a nailgun, but I never really used it.
Combat is a very low priority in a game like this, so in my honest opinion, it is slightly irrelevant when it comes to my overall impressions of the game.
The crafting system on the other hand is very well done.
It can be a little tedious at times, but this is likely a gameplay design intended to discourage hand crafting and encourage automation.
The to-do list and “press x” feature make it much easier to handle.
You cannot automate the production of buildings like you can in Factorio and Dyson Sphere Program. This is an intended gameplay design, but I’m not too sure I’m that big of a fan of it. Either way, it was easy to adjust my playstyle to just having various materials on hand rather than carrying various buildings around with me.


Multiplayer is a ton of fun and implemented quite well, but even the devs have said it is still unfinished and unstable. You will likely run into minor issues here and there, such as visual glitches (like the giant item glitch), desync issues, and items disappearing. Overall it’s done quite well and I’ve hardly had any problems, but they do exist, so I can’t give it a 5/5.
Be sure to adjust network quality settings to the highest possible for all players.


The progression system in this game feels very good, excluding a few difficulty hurdles.
You advance pretty steadily and you can definitely feel that advancement as you move on.
You advance similarly to how you build up: in a more multiplicative way than an additive way.
It does start to feel a bit “grindy” towards the end. Progression definitely slows down more and more as you get into the higher tiers, and it can get to be quite tedious and drawn out in the very late game. This absolutely works for some people, and it worked for me up until the very end of the game, where I simply lost interest because I had essentially unlocked everything.


You have to look for the humor in this type of game to find it; it isn’t right in your face, but similarly to Astroneer, it comes mostly from the hilarious possibilities allowed through the physics system. There are all kinds of things you can do to propel yourself and ragdoll your character or even launch yourself into the atmosphere.
There are also subtle little comedic aspects presented through ADA, some of the tooltips, and the funny writings found inside the HUB.
Most of the machines also have funny names that represent their job.

Despite the non-perfect rating, I would not hesitate one bit to highly recommend this game to anyone who is interested in math, ratios, automation, production, assembly lines, and factory style games. Even if you aren’t a math person, like yours truly, you can easily adjust your playstyle accordingly and find plenty of joy in this game. Maybe it will even help you discover a love or appreciation for numbers that you never knew was there.",1,6124,250.5,July 28

But ultimately it's another grinder; make X widgets with a different formula from the last 30 widgets.

Trying to scale that up to a reasonable number requires a simply enormous factory; I think I spent about 20 hours building it before I finally decided that it's just not worth the time spent.

It would be a lot better if the game itself, not mods from random sources, had a copy-and-paste function to help build large structures, instead of making the player make hundreds and thousands of individual components and then connecting them with individual cables (for power) and conveyors (for materials).

There's also no way to manage buildings except by going to them and interacting with them directly.

279,"TL:DR Summary: If you buy this game it will consume you, as it triggers the same parts of your brain as completing a multi-month hobby project.

Satisfactory...the first game I have ever felt compelled to write a review for. If you are familiar with games like Factorio, Space Engineers, or Dyson Sphere Project, you will have an easier time in your first few hours. Don't worry though, if you are new to this genre, I can not think of a better game to start with. Not necessarily because it's easier than those other games, but because it is by far the most REWARDING.

You begin by choosing a starting location, this is an important choice (ease of building/danger vs. richness of resources) and I would recommend starting in one of the first 2 locations on your first play-through. The nice thing is though, you can visit all of them eventually. The map is HUGE, and I love that no matter where you start, you can end up building in the hardest location later on if you wish. Speaking of the map, WOW, is it gorgeous. You could start in the lush green grassy plains and end up in an unforgiving red canyon hell by the end. There is so much variety to every biome that I was still finding fresh looking areas 30+ hours in. There isn't a lot of variety to the wildlife, but there is enough to keep things interesting.

Moving onto the game-play loop, it starts out simple enough. Mine resources and use those to craft items to craft other things and so on. HOWEVER, it does not stay this stale for very long. Soon you will have automated miners feeding into smelters, which feed into constructors, which build the item resources needed to supply assemblers with 2 different parts to craft another, more complex part. Then you will need to route the end line of this to a SPACE ELEVATOR and send it into orbit. I was in awe with how quickly the scale of my factory grew as I was able to automate more and more of my production...and that's just the first 2 tiers of milestones, there are a total of 8 tiers....and it gets BIG and COMPLEX.

Combat is....meh. Not many things to fight, although what is there provides enough of a challenge. Normally you will find hostile enemies near resources or crash sites (oh yeah btw you can find alternate recipes for items in wrecks...to add to the variety of problem solving tools). You start out with a little taser weapon and can later upgrade that further. There are also a few ranged options, but again, combat is not a focus here.

Graphics are amazing, from the incredible art design for each piece of machinery to the planet itself, eye candy is abundant. What really stood out to me though was the quality of the ANIMATIONS! Wow, some of those animations (like when you first build the space elevator) are insanely impressive.

I'm going to wrap up this review now because I could go on an on, but you should really experience this for yourself. I will end with this though....you can build trains, trucks, buggies, jetpacks, and my fav....HYPERTUBES. There is no end to how creative you can get with your factory.

I cannot believe this is Early Access, best $30 I've ever spent, buy it and lose yourself in the gears of your creation. Also...don't go into caves unprepared :D",1,2671,101.3,July 27

354,"I've been a gamer for over thirty years, and now that I've put in nearly 300 hours in Satisfactory and built everything there is to build, I can safely say it's one of my favorite games of all time. It's easily in my top 5, and considering it's still in early access at the time I'm typing this with many more features and improvements yet to come, that's really saying something.

First, don't look at those screenshots of countless machines and mazes of conveyor belts and pipes and think 'omg, this looks way too complicated for me'. Screenshots like those are not the best representation of the game for new players, and they're almost certainly from the late game (or mid-game at the earliest). You're not gonna be at that point for awhile, and Satisfactory actually does a great job of gradually introducing new builds and concepts to you as you progress. You start off with just a few simple things to build and nothing but a little craft bench to build them with, and as you advance through the tiers, you get more and more new parts, machines, and other stuff unlocked. Then, before you know it, you'll have your first automated assembly line making iron plates and rods.

Make no mistake, this is a game that will make you use your noggin a bit. You don't need to be a genius, but there will be times where you'll need to do some math and calculations to maximize efficiency. A simple example: machine A can produce 60 iron ore per minute, machine B turns 30 iron ore per minute into 30 iron ingots per minute. So how many machine B's will you need to utilize the production capacity of machine A? (Answer is two) :) Questions like this will present themselves regularly as you build and expand, and although it certainly gets more complicated than my example (especially in the mid to late game), you should be fine even if you're only halfway decent at basic arithmetic.

Power is another critical part of the game. With the exception of conveyor belts, your machines don't run on magic - they need electricity or else they're useless chunks of metal. To start with, you're given a weak, primitive means of generating power that cannot be automated, and as you experience your first blown fuse (which happens when your power consumption exceeds your power generating capacity) and/or your first power grid shut down because you haven't manually filled it with fuel in the last twenty minutes, you'll start growing tired of it. :) But good news! The second power source you unlock (and all the others after that) generate way more power and can be 100% automated. In other words, if setup right, it'll generate power for you forever without you ever having to think about or touch it ever again. Complete game changer.

Feel like taking a break from the machines and conveyor belts for a bit? That's perfectly fine! In fact, this is encouraged - there's a beautiful, vast world for you to explore with all kinds of surprises and things to find, many of which will be very helpful later on (if not immediately). Just be careful - there are plenty of hazards out there too. This is one of the great things about this game though - you have complete freedom to do whatever you want whenever you want.

You'll encounter little quirks and bugs once in awhile, but they're all minor and don't detract from the experience. Overall the game is very stable, well-built, and runs just as good, if not better than most games NOT in early access. The game is truly fantastic, and once it comes out of early access, I'm very confident it will get nothing but fantastic reviews from all publications. Just look at the Steam reviews - an astounding 97% are positive, and it's completely deserved - this is an amazing game. It's $30 US, yet it's already far better than most $60 AAA games.

You can either be messy and have a sprawling factory tangle or you can dive in and use custom foundations and walls to build up organized factory complexes. One hing that I personally would love to see is more unlockable walls, foundations, and support styles through the sync. Also adding a bit more variation in the ""wildlife"" would be swell, tho I'm sure that with all the other mechanics going on that would be difficult given functionality.

408,"SATISFACTORY (genre: factory building)
SCORE: 9/10 (COULD BE HIGHER! UP TO 9.5)
This game is great and you could see this in other reviews as well but the games is still lacking things.
-1st thing, the Production Speed is still IMO, not that fantastic, but it could be based on my personal preference. For me if the production and manufacturing got sped up by 25% I would have been addictive to it.
-2nd thing, the conveyor system is still buggy and can be dug into the ground but it is not a big of a problem for me.
-3rd thing, the power system is not 100% polished and solely based on using products, should add Solar Panels or Wind Turbines in the future.
-4th thing, THE GAME HAVE SO MANY POTENTIAL TO EXPAND EVEN MORE WITH SUCH RESPONSIVE DEVELOPERS team and even though the game is pretty fun right now but imagine this:
*Adding a better economy/trading system in the games, for example building computer rigs to ""mine"" crypto currencies, the unified currencies of trans solar civilization to trade. Or even to push it further, to have a trans galactic economy system which you could invest in different galactic companies, etc. Holly s* I would be addict to this game if it did have it.
*The planet is beautiful and fun to explore, but not so fun anymore after you've spent sometimes exploring it as it became cliche natural world. Imagine every single planets or areas having their own characteristic to push the players to explore even more. For example, having an outrageous high mountainous areas which reward the players exploring it by finding a cave full of exotic materials near the top of the highest mountain, or slaying Alien Dragons living in the caves for exotic drops. Also adding Giant Alien Beasts with its nest deep in the forest, etc. And trading the rewards getting from slaying such beasts would reward the players greatly. I have saw Coffee Stain having experience in games like Deep Rock Galactic too and IMO, the games could thrive further on the mechanism of exploring and getting rewards from slaying different alien beasts mechanism
*Or even have smart aliens society which are living in their own little settlement or village who would trade with exotic stuffs for your technology.
*This game have so much potential in multiplayer too, having laughed my A* out when I saw my friends screamed at the top of his lungs when he was attacked by those terrifying cave spiders, and you could add many different things in future for the players to mess around, like different clothing, personal gadgets, even more furniture, wall designs, toys, or even board games and billiards for the players in the same server could play with each others.
*I would say as many other players have suggested this idea too, you could even expand the game to space by adding space ships, etc. but for me, I wouldn't push it, because many other games have done this too, and i don't want to lost all of the current characteristic and charm of this game by changing it that way. Those game thrived on player travelling different planets and their planet is very unrealistically small and not complex, but seriously, one planet is way too big already and you could still expand the world on it and I will respect you for being different.
In Conclusion: this game is near 90% polished and could add so many things into the game in the future as it is still in Early Access (The New Oldest Trick in the book huh?) And I am expecting so much more from it.",1,2877,13.0,July 23

Creating massive production lines drawing from resources across the map all to a single place to create one single item feels pretty gratifying, and the game definately adds enough customization and choices in how you build your factory to make it truly unique. The map is also big, really big, and pretty diverse so its actually pretty enjoyable to explore. Definitely going to sink many more hours into this game. 10/10",1,636,93.4,July 23

-good graphics
-well designed maps, beautiful + no out of place clipping etc.
-amazing game play, especially if you're mechanically inclined.
-very easy to setup multiplayer, was able to jump right in with no issues.
-no major bugs or glitches that I've had to experience yet.

Cons:
-not very many different maps, which I would assume can cause game play to eventually stagnate. [Edit] At the time of making this I didn't realize there was only one map. But I see now that it is a large single map, with many possibilities. So if it's a negative or not is in the eye of the beholder.

Maybe could add variants of ore etc. to add a splash of variation to the game, but other than that I can't think of anything I dislike.

Satisfactory is a game where you build factories. (no duh)
Start by mining your resources by hand, then get portable miners to help speed up that process

Sidenote:
I was - Honestly - stunned how good this game looks.
if you don't like factory building or maybe you need a break from it

just explore the beautiful, absolutely gorgeous world.
(I cannot think of enough adjectives to describe this game)
And my 2yo. laptop had barely a problem running it.
At standard graphics settings I got about 40-60 fps

(just a bit jittery though so I turned the shadow
and post-processing quality to high instead of ultra)

Eventually unlocking Miners, Constructors, Smelters
& Conveyor belts to automate your work for you.

Each building has it's own production rates and resource requirements,
Necessitating good Multiplication, Division and Addition skills.

I personally, recommend you to try to achieve maximum efficiency in your buildings.
Not only because I like math
As that will ensure you get as much done as an overproducing factory setup,
But without the increased power consumption with virtually no benefit.
(and more than an under producing factory, obviously)

I've only gotten to tiers 5 or 6 in about 50h
(idk, MeMoRy BaD)
But even with the slow progression I still had lots of fun

I'm hooked on this game lol
Like all my favorite things in one
Space, Math, g-game uh... yummy sounds?

Also there's a not-so hidden easter egg with the Somersloops or mercer spheres...
where if you stand near it for a long enough time you will hear as ADA tries harder and harder
to convince you to pick it up.
Maybe not game changing but, I thought i'd bring it up.
if you want you can try it for yourself. remember you'll need to stand there for about 3-4 minutes to get all the voice lines
You will hear some weird distorted audio that sounds like the vowel A right before she starts to speak.

498,"At the time of this review I have finished tiers 6 & 7 and the game is still in early access. My review goes over what I have experienced so some information about the game might not have been available to me. Additionally, the review contains spoilers so read at your own risk:

Satisfactory is the sort of game that at a glance would make you think that it's pretty fun and you wouldn't be wrong to think that. The game features 8 tiers of new and upgraded items, buildings, vehicles and more to help expand your forever-growing factory at the expense of the amount of hours you pour into the game.
What's great about the game is that it's a genre that isn't as popular as your average FPS, Battle Royale or RPG so it was something that peaked my interest straight away (Take into consideration that I've never played another factory game such as Factorio).

A couple hours into the game I was still experiencing new features such as it's pretty large yet lacking map - I chose the grass fields as my starting point due to my first time playing the game: the main reasons of exploring the map are for hard drives unlocking alternate crafting recipes, resources like coal and water (mid-game) for more power, power slugs to boost your factory production however not always efficiency and maybe even leaves if you haven't progressed that far. This may seem like a lot at first but really isn't after going out of your way to get more power slugs for the 80th time. To combat how boring that may become, you are faced with 4 types of creatures: charging dogs, dogs that shoots fireballs (other variants shoot some blue stuff), rotund larvae with wings that emerge from plants and creepy spiders who are by far the scariest to run away from. They all have their mini-boss forms as well which aren't any harder, they just have one extra attack and have more health.

Now for the factory itself, the game's selling point. To progress through the game you must build from resources scattered around the map to manufacture products such as iron rods, screws, copper wire and a whole lot more. As ADA mentions at the start of the game, your objective is to be as efficient as possible and to not waste; in order to do this you must calculate EVERYTHING so that you don't overproduce or underproduce which can cause products to take 100x longer to make. Watching Youtube videos on how to make your factory more efficient is just a waste of money, you might as well not play the game if you're just going to copy someone else. Making mistakes with your placements could potentially mean you have to rebuild your entire factory which sounds like a real pain in the ass because it is. For this reason alone, I wouldn't like to spend more time playing this game just so I can watch more products being made.

In conclusion: This game is fun for the first 30-40 hours but then can get repetitive for most people unless you're into building factories (once again, if you enjoyed or liked factorio then this game is probably for you). I wish to see future updates that improve the amount of content in this game and potentially more features to make the game fun for a wider variety of people. I'll still recommend this game but I wouldn't recommend paying full price right now unless you're confident with the game as it is in its current state or unless you're able to trust the developers of the game to make a good finished game. Personally, I believe Coffee Stain Studios are amazing developers after seeing and playing their other games such as Valheim, Goat Simulator and Sanctum 2.",1,2956,50.1,July 21

Its simple if you have power backup grid, but if you don't, you have to switch up all your power slowly by switch off all your machines power.

Map is very large, unique and beautiful to explore. I just explored 3/20 of the map and it has large enough for me.

529,"This may very well be the best game I’ve ever played. Games like this one very rare. I love the concept and execution of the concept of this game. I’ve never left a review for a game before, but this one definitely deserves nothing but positive reviews. I am looking forward anxiously for Update 5. Until then here are my only two suggestions: 1. Make mass building easier. I am currently working on a mega base (75x75 for the base layer) and it took nearly 5 hours just to do the first level. I then installed the SMART mod and it took only 10 seconds to build what before took hours. I think that a change like this would make building less of an obstacle. As the game currently is, building is a hugely unnecessary obstacle for building massive factories. 2. Add a second body slot. Constantly changing between jetpack, blade runners, gas mask, and soon hover pack is excessively aggravating. Body slots are the one thing in the game that never improve, change, or get better. What you start with is what you get.

Overall, despite the two very annoying things I meantioned (which i fixed with mods anyway so it’s fine) I couldn’t reccomend this game enough to anyone who loves open world, building, survival style games. Or anyone who wants to try something new!",1,1059,80.9,July 20

They have greatly increased the life-expectancy of those of us who live in “advanced” countries, but they have destabilized society, have made life unfulfilling, have subjected human beings to indignities, have led to widespread psychological suffering (in the Third World to physical suffering as well) and have inflicted severe damage on the natural world. The continued development of technology will worsen the situation. It will certainly subject human being to greater indignities and inflict greater damage on the natural world, it will probably lead to greater social disruption and psychological suffering, and it may lead to increased physical suffering even in “advanced” countries. The industrial-technological system may survive or it may break down. If it survives, it MAY eventually achieve a low level of physical and psychological suffering, but only after passing through a long and very painful period of adjustment and only at the cost of permanently reducing human beings and many other living organisms to engineered products and mere cogs in the social machine. Furthermore, if the system survives, the consequences will be inevitable: There is no way of reforming or modifying the system so as to prevent it from depriving people of dignity and autonomy. If the system breaks down the consequences will still be very painful. But the bigger the system grows the more disastrous the results of its breakdown will be, so if it is to break down it had best break down sooner rather than later. We therefore advocate a revolution against the industrial system. This revolution may or may not make use of violence; it may be sudden or it may be a relatively gradual process spanning a few decades. We can’t predict any of that. But we do outline in a very general way the measures that those who hate the industrial system should take in order to prepare the way for a revolution against that form of society. This is not to be a POLITICAL revolution. Its object will be to overthrow not governments but the economic and technological basis of the present society. In this article we give attention to only some of the negative developments that have grown out of the industrial-technological system. Other such developments we mention only briefly or ignore altogether. This does not mean that we regard these other developments as unimportant. For practical reasons we have to confine our discussion to areas that have received insufficient public attention or in which we have something new to say. For example, since there are well-developed environmental and wilderness movements, we have written very little about environmental degradation or the destruction of wild nature, even though we consider these to be highly important.

569,"It's the most addictive, brain-teaser and awe-inspiring base building game I've played! I can easily play this game until 2 AM, it's so satisfying (no, really) to see your factory grow from basically nothing. I love the creative features of the game, like the flying manta ray and her puppies, or the giant potato-like buddy that comes to check out new parts of your base. The landscapes are insanely beautiful, I love the pink forest and the waterfalls the most.

A bit of advice: if there's anything that looks like a green cloud of fart, STAY AWAY. It's radiation and you'll lose health! The neatest feature of the game is taming the , who bring you awesome gifts like caterium, power slugs or SAM ore in exchange for head rubs and raspberries.

The enemies in this game are not a complex hive mind to defeat most of them are guarding resources and its usually simple hack and slash while running backwards. If you were like me and were expecting a randomized world it is not but the terrain that was created has a lot of fun and challenging obstacles which can usually be handled more than one way.

615,"Satisfactory is not a bad game. But i sure as hell can not recommend it. The high ratings puzzle me. The game is tedious, frustrating and feels like it intentionally slows you down a lot of the time. I'm a big factory building fan, so it's not a problem with the genre. There is a difference between spending 50 hours in Factorio, designing a modular nuclear reactor you can re-use over and over, or spending 50 hours in Satisfactory just placing down stuff manually. For a game about automation, Satisfactory consists of mostly all manual effort.

Factory Building:
A lot of convenient objects and features are missing. No signs to label things. No GUI overlay to help identify which constructor produces what. No junctions for hypertubes. Sorting is not available early-game. No Logic. A lot of little, important things like that. You cant even limit how many items go into a container. Gotta fill the other slots with sticks and stones if you want some additional stacks, but then forget about connecting that container to a belt in the future.
I'm not a fan of clipping objects. ""Belt too steep"" or ""Belt has an invalid shape"" are common things to read. So why is it okay for belts to literally clip through each other? This is not an exploit either, simply the default behavior. It causes real problems as well. Sometimes you place things that appear perfectly connected, just to later notice they are not working because the belt goes from A to B while your merger just sits at the perfect location, but attached to the ground instead, with the belt clipping right through it.
And monorail track placement gives me nightmares.


There are basically no convenience features. Nothing you can do to speed up building stuff. Blueprints would be really helpful. But at the very least give us to speed up building. Need a 100x100 concrete platform? That's 10.000 individual object placements and there is nothing you can do about that. Remember this is a factory building game. This is not an exaggerated example.

Let me just name one more example for how problematic this is. A single MK5 belt can transport 780 items per minute. Say we wanted to turn that into iron rods, which happens at a rate of 15 per minute per constructor. That is 780/15 = 52 constructors. Together with about the same amount of splitters, and mergers, a couple douzen power poles or so, and of course the belts to connect it all. Each of which is to be placed manually. But that's not all. The recipe for each individual constructor has to be set individually, inside the GUI of the corresponding constructor. Not just that; every single power line connecting any power poles or consumers, has to be placed manually as well. Every. Single. Powerline. Let that sink in please.


Animations are mostly well done, but pretty long. Usually this is not a problem, except when it is. Loading or unloading a train? That's 25 seconds each. Drones are even worse. But that's fine as those are meant for long distances anyways. What's not fine is that these animations actively lock up the stations. While loading a train, a station does not accept items. While unloading a train, a station does not output items. This seriously messes with calculations. The only proper way to guarantee a constant output is using a container as buffer, which effectively halves the output ports, thus doubles train length and with that the amount of stations required. Did i mention how huge these are? The 100x100 platform example was not an exaggeration, but an understatement.


There is only one map, with four spawns. To be fair the map is quite large and definitely beautiful. This still heavily reduces replay value tho. The ressource distribution, unless randomized, is also questionable. We only had normal and impure ressources around our spawn, leading us to believe pure ressources were quite rare - which would make sense. We then later found huge clusters of pure ressource nodes close to each other. Using boosters on those, they are basically easily enough to fill all your needs - and we are talking about quite a large factory already.
A lot of the problems i have with this game feel like they are intended to slow the player down. Which may be related to just having one single finite map. My biggest complaint about the map however, or rather minimap, is how you . I mean, cmon? There is a huge satisfaction in seeing your factory grow on a global scale, covering large parts of the map. But there is also practical use to this, for planning where train tracks may end, or seeing in a distance where you would connect things together and so on. None of that is possible.


Expect to run . Our starting base A and our later main base B was separated by a good 10 minutes of walking, on a flat and mostly straight path we build for that purpose over the ocean.
We later connected most of the important locations using hypertubes. Using entrances as boosters (likely not intened but fun), you can reach ridiculous speeds and cover the same distance in 20-30 seconds. So what about some place C in the middle? There are no official hypertube junctions. Cmon, who implements a tube network without thinking about junctions? I managed to work something out, but considering how bad high speeds already work in multiplayer, proper junctions shouldnt be an afterthought.


Vehicles suffer from several problems. They are slow, considering the distances. For automation this is fine, for personal travel it's not. Some of them handle extremely unwell. I managed to 180° nose-flip the 6-wheel 10-ton-looking Truck on a flat road with low speeds by hitting a pebble.
Trains were one of my biggest disappointment. With 120 kmh they are the fastest ground based vehicles. For personal travel to feel enjoyable you may as well double that tho. But that's not why they are disappointing to use. Steering is - or rather how you cant do that. Yeah, you read right. In order to change directions you have to brake the train to a full stop, get out of it, manually pull a lever which spawns on junctions to switch ""default directions"", get back into the train and accelerate again. The animations for accelerating and braking are nice, but it takes soo much time to do so. And as such it is insanely impractical to use trains for anything except a pre-setup path from A to B. The autopilot does not care about the levers, so they basically only exist to annoy and discorage players. Who in their right mind thought this was a good idea?


Let's ignore hand-slots as those are mostly for combat. There is . In this slot you can either equip your ""running shoes"", jetpack, gas mask or hazmat suit. Did i mention how slow travelling feels? Wouldnt it be nice to have faster movement speed while also being able to slightly float upwards? Or not suffocate in the poison gas covering half the map? Or not die of radiation poisoning when you run past uranium? Every time you encounter one of these situations you have to switch out your current equipment. Which also means you have to carry them all around. Let us combine them. Or give us at least 2 body slots. It's not like these items are OP either. The jetpack only covers a couple vertical meters and needs fuel. The gas mask requires filters, and so on.


Performance is not the best, could be worse tho. Autosaves, once your factory grew enough, just completely freeze the game for a second or two every five minutes. Game crashed a hand full of times in our playthrough. Multiplayer has certain problems, but considering everything else works decent.

I would recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a nice relaxing automation game thats like factorio but with much better graphics and in the first person.

773,"Most people run when they hear Early Access but I have conplete faith this game will be completed.

The discord for the game is active and the Devs often do a twitch stream that is open to questions. They update you on the progress being made and what will come in future updates. The updates offer lots of new content to an already amazing game. The devs take bugs seriously and work to fix them quickly.
The gameplay is addictive and well thought out with good progression. Graphics look pretty good and the gameplay works well for me. It has a simple goal with an infinite amount of possibilities.

Warning there are some weird alien type creatures that roam the planet, some of them make me uncomfortable so if youre bothered easily by those types of things please research them and get familiar before you get the game.

This game will continue to be worked on and will see a full release once the amazing team of devs consider it ready. It deserves a chance and if you don't like it then you can always refund it

It deserves a solid 8.75/10",1,879,18.0,July 15

Only 40hrs of vacation time, sadly... so not a good deal... but Id make it again, if thats what youre asking.

It clearly has a long way to go, so don't buy it if you want a smooth, polished experience. But it's entirely playable and highly enjoyable. I'm 15 hours into my second attempt and all I want to do is start over because I know so much! But instead, I just unhook old base, start new base ... OMG this one is going to be 4 levels high!

785,"I don't understand why this game got so popular.

I guess there are people in the world that believe ""game"" includes performing a trivial task repeatedly without any chance of failure or obstacle to overcome.

For me, I want to fail, I want to be challenged, I want my neurons to fire. The only challenge in this game seems to be the calculation of fractions when you figure the output of one machine and the input of another. Hell, that is barely even there, since most people just use an online tool to do that calculation for them. At any rate, I mastered that skill in second grade, 36 years ago. Your mileage may vary depending on your education system.

I suppose you could build things to be pleasing to the eye, and line it all up with right angles or multiple floors vertically, but why would you? No one is going to see it.

Other than that, I found myself, simply building the same thing, as needed, over and over and over again, with no purpose, no obstacle, and no challenge. The game doesn't even let you save a blueprint, so once you spend three hours lining everything up for item X, you have to do it all over again in another spot when you need more of item X.

It isn't possible to lose at all, and that's a huge turn off for me. It's an exercise of how many times I can do the same thing over hours until boredom prevents me from playing anymore.

I enjoyed Factorio quite a bit more, simply because there was opposition and the possibility of losing. In Satisfactory, both resources and time are infinite. This truly is a game for people to turn off their brains. I want to exercise mine. I have a backyard full of grass I can watch grow if I want to.",0,1382,61.7,July 14

798,"Excellent fun for those who like to gather and build. The critters are not overly challenging. The spiders are appropriately creepy. The critters stay gone once vanquished. The rifle is underpowered. I did not find anything too onerous. Once I set out to do a project, I was able to complete it. I am confused by the world edges, as some you fall off, and others hurt you, while another just kills you immediately.

Eventually though you get the hang of it and it just clicks. From what I have heard its like a first person Factorio (which is a game I haven't played yet as of writing of this review) which I can't attest to how accurate that assessment is. Try to get friends who already have and played this game to help you guide through it. After which the single player is just as good as multiplayer, you just get more help in multiplayer of course. Overall, not a bad early access game, which surprises me why it hasn't officially release yet since it actually functions well for the most part and has a lot of content already.",1,641,113.0,July 14

With all the content they have released so far it is still playable. This game is basically a 3D version of factorio with better graphics. To make the game much better make sure to get SMM (Satisfactory Mod Manager), trust me it add more content that will make your factory look amazing. I have built giant factories with the help of mods.

Playing with only Vanilla items will take up a lot of your time and your factory may not look neat. The modding community is still very active and will help you out on there discord channel:

The only major cons of the game are its still beta so it has its bugs from clipping terrain to wonky conveyor belts sometimes the visuals are definitely lacking, another massive con is because this game has no other NPCS except for an AI female voice it gets boring normally you would just play multiplayer however after you start getting into the point of coal which is a very early stage the game becomes very buggy in multiplayer so long hours are not something i really see myself doing however if you do just enjoy engineering factories solo thats cool.

Id personally recommend this game to anybody in the market for something new the best deal your gonna get is 23.99 on sale so just pay full price and support the devs you will learn quickly that 6$ was much better spent on this game rather then a big mac :)",1,1207,13.7,July 13

838,You can get lost with exploring and building. The factory building is by far the best aspect for me.

839,"The game is still incomplete, yet it feels so polished and well-made. Every update brings unique new things and adds a lot of hours to exploration and progressing your factory. The system is very well-made and structurally good as a progression system, and it's very rewarding. The replay-ability is endless, because you can play the game in many different ways, go about things in different ways, you can also make a lot of different factories with different structures the game offers you.

There are different maps, they are all very well designed. Graphics are amazing as well as performance. I also haven't found any major / game breaking bugs that make the game unplayable or straight up broken to the point it's not fun.

Multiplayer is not flawless but really fun together. All around it's a really great game, it has enough combat which is challenging but not overpowering, the progression feels very rewarding and even starting over isn't a big deal because of the variety in things you can do and how you can go about stuff.

858,"As a Factorio veteran this game gets an easy recommendation from me. Although I want to say that the emphasis with Satisfactory is on a different part of the factory building experience. Whereas Factorio rewards and almost requires laying out your entire base towards efficient mass-production, Satisfactory is more open towards more relaxed styles of play and building. Veterans may still want to build a single massive mega-factory with all resources coming in on one side to produce every possible product in the game on a main bus system. But at least for a first playthrough I have found it to be very enjoyable to place individual and disjoint factory buildings all over the place, producing individual products where convenient to then later collect them when needed or automate their transport. The foundation, wall and walkway options provided make it possible to create very beautiful factory buildings that nestle into the varied and rugged terrain. Planning and filling out a new factory building is always immensely satisfying for me as it all comes from nothing into a sleek and well-organized production setup.

Unlocking new technologies is paced well and drives forward the process of expansion. Exploration takes more time than in Factorio but feels really great thanks to the beautiful landscapes. Barriers like destructible rock and gas clouds will impede progress until you can build the countermeasures. Finding and exploiting a new resource site will have a big impact and let you advance technologically. Finally, there is always room to automate more and to further increase production of needed resources.

Honestly the only disappointment I had with the game is that there are so few ways to change the natural environment to clear the way for a megafactory. The world is handcrafted and hills can't be flattened to create a flat plain to build your factory on. Hence why it's mostly easier to build smaller separate factories. I like that playstyle very well, but I wish there was the option to just build it all in one place like with Factorio. That being said I have only played on the first map, maybe others have more open space available. The alternative is of course for the player to build a giant platform in the sky suspended on pillars to be their artificial flat factory floor. For me that option has proven a bit too silly to actually implement.",1,2008,55.8,July 13

969,"At the 40 hour mark, this game became so mind numbingly tedious that it became unenjoyable. I hope you enjoy spending literal days trying to unlock the rest of the gameplay with the world's most boring and painful grind because thats what you're going to get.

It took 5 full days of play just to unlock tiers 5 and 6. Now we have to make 4x the amount of stuff with about 10x the work to get to Tiers 7 and 8. We've barely made a dent in it, its been 3 days. It used to be easier, but they made it harder to pad the gameplay because it's an EA title.

Which was absolutely unnecessary, this game can be really fun on its own without excessive amounts of grind.

Also, have fun trying to make the stuff you need when the game glitches out and machines won't work or you can't build. That's going to make the grind even harder.

I say just make a few bosses that will drop resources you may need to progress to the next tier and maybe add a more advance weapon system.

(Edit:) The game has been keeping me up at night until I pass out, I'm not even through tier 6-7 research and as I begin working with fluids I realize that my areas are poorly designed and need to be organized over a large flat plane, and not snaking foundations over cliff faces.

1017,"If you've been considering this game, you should absolutely give it a try, and you'll probably get hooked just like I did.

Satisfactory is an amazing game. Not just in the factory building aspect, but also in many other ways.

Obviously, this game is about making a factory. And that it does excellently - goals are clear, it's easy to pick up and keeps you engaged, it's extremely satisfying and it makes your brain work. I know there have been many times where I've built a brand new production line and just stared at it for 10 or 15 mins watching the materials move through the conveyors I just built. It's so satisfying. There's always something new to do or discover, and each tier brings exciting new machines and materials to play with. The progression is excellent too, with the game guiding you to where you need to go but also giving you the freedom to build the biggest factory you want at any point. There are so many dimensions and so many things you can produce in so many different ways - it gives you a framework and then you're free to do whatever.

The graphics are really nice and everything is super detailed. The animations in this game are AWESOME - even early on you start to get multiple favourite animations that you just watch over and over again.

Even though it's a building game, it's also one of exploration. And surprisingly, that it does really well too. The combat, once you get a past the xeno zapper (which happens pretty quickly) is fun, engaging, and satisfying. The alien enemies are well done - I also loved Subnautica, and some of them got me almost as scared as being chased by a reaper leviathan. The enemy design is also really unique - I absolutely didn't expect these going into the game. Apparently there's a story coming by 1.0, too, and it's already written - I'd love that, there's so much potential for a great narrative for this game.

The exploration is great, with the environments being far away but not too far, and each is very unique and very beautiful. All the biomes are different to each other and exploring through them for the first time is really fun and interesting.

Overall, almost every aspect of this game is great and I can barely think of flaws. There's a few bugs here and there, quality of life things, etc, but the graphics are great, the gameplay loop is great, the factory building aspect is well thought out and very fun, and the world in which the game is set is beautiful and interesting.

All this praise, and this game is still early access. Coffee Stain has done an amazing job so far, and I'm sure they'll continue to deliver with Satisfactory.",1,2181,69.1,July 10

The first 30 mins of the game is a bit hard to get into. I feel like there's improvement to be made there.
Personally I think holding the hand of the player for that duration would be helpful. It would help not feeling like you've never done this before.

I was skeptical that this would just be a ""real-life lite"" simulator, but setting up factories and supply chains is surprisingly fun and intuitive right out the gate and incredibly rewarding to master.

Jokes aside, I used to imagine having a game like this.

I don't have the best PC Ever and it looks incredible even with the graphics turned way, way down. The best way to describe it would be a first person Factorio. But in terms of performance I've experienced some minor stutter, which I hope goes away after early access, that said it's not enough to stop me from playing, as this game is excellent.

I've never really got into open world games like Skyrim, Fallout, etc but this is the first one I can see myself playing hundreds of hours. I look forward to the development of this game, and may even build a better pc later just to be able to play it at higher settings.",1,841,12.7,July 8

1117,"I will attempt to be clear in brief: It is not worth it's price. Plain and simple. It is a fun game, it is a game that had me play it for 8 straight hours, but I got it on sale and imagined it to be a cleaner looking Factorio. But it isn't, at least not yet. If I may recommend such a game, it's Dyson Sphere Program.

Issues and Solutions
It severely lacks the (what I find to be a very simple yet effective system) basic research system. Using basic mats to create basic research tokens and scaling that. Instead it desires the player to create more and more nonsense from basic resources. I generally dislike it but that may be a person gripe. What however I believe are the two most disruptive parts of this game are as follows: 1. The exploration and 2. The M.A.M. research aside from the Space Elevator research. The exploration is great, for the first time. But the world is not procedural, it is a created map, good for introducing players and very poor for keeping players engaged when they must inhabit the same map constantly. The MAM research, and specifically the alternative research paths are absolutely awful. They don't inspire me to create new factories, they push me to tear down my construction of which I already spent so long optimizing to do it all over again, that is not the game play loop I enjoy. If they were given immediately I wouldn't have issue, they'd allow the player to experiment to find which recipe actually created the best result, instead of handing me a new recipe which is simply a direct upgrade to my current system but is incompatible with it. But nonetheless; I have what I believe to be a very perfect analogy for this game. This is No Man's Sky with automation, and without ships. Now hear me out Devs, what if...what if you put those together, and make a small solar system that can use the existing maps and allows players to still chose starting locations but has very different experiences for the different locations allowing varied play styles on each planet and in the 'end game' you then travel to the different planets and start colonies to feed your mecha world? It sounds like a fun game to me, and would add a lot of depth.",0,1805,8.1,July 8

It's not unusual for me to try a highly praised game and get bored after an hour or two.

Bought this, tried it out. The first night I stayed up to 6am and went to bed only so my girlfriend wouldn't realize how long I had stayed up. I dreamt of factories.

Then the next day I pretty much ignored her and continued to optimize and build factories.

Then I stayed up and continued playing until 6am again.

At some point I'll install the game again and lie to her about working long hours, but until then all I have to say is that it got more out of me in a week than almost any other game has in years.

1188,"ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS GAME! It's sad that it's so under rated. I've got 87 hrs played as of writing this review, and that's just on Steam, not to mention my ungodly amount of time in the first platform it was released on. The amount of time you can spend just gathering resources at first, then tear it down and get more organized, get faster, get upgrades, and so much more!

Not to mention all the exploring you get to do in a very well made world with fona and flora. It's so easy to sink in this game and get lost and just enjoy every aspect of it.

For those that rate this game as NOT good, I tend to see you only have less than 10 hours played. You really need to get much further and more time into it to really give this a fair review, otherwise, I personally don't consider reviews with less than 10 hours played to be honest. There's too many reviews that also bicker and whine about the gameplay which is super minor compared to what does work and is usable.

I love a game that forces me to think instead of mindless blasting. Although don't get me wrong, sometimes we all need to do a little mindless blasting to blow off some steam. This game is that, but it's relaxing, fun and well worth your $30.

It's the sort of game where you've always got 5 tasks you want to complete, and every completed task makes you realize there are 2 more things you need to do. You can stop any time you want, but natural stopping points are rare, and thus this game can eat up the hours like few can. If you're the sort to spend all night playing Rimworld, this game will consume you.

Beware that in addition to the GPU, this game is very intensive on your CPU, especially as your factory grows. I had to abandon the game for a while because my old computer was CPU-bottlenecked.",1,627,200.9,July 7
1211,"Great, really great impression by early access game. The maps are large and populated. Easily unerstandable gameplay, decent UI nad UX (for early access). Open world with seamlessly integrated story and discover surpizes. By the time of review the game is in state when its gameplay quite good balanced between calm and adventurous. Grinding-like gameplay is a part of fun in these games.

Good quality of world design, although it lacks some randomality when i restart the sesstion. Thus Satisfactory could benefit from implementation of balanced semi-random resource allocation and repopulating of the world at start. Looking for resources and optimal placement each time would add more replayability. Additionaly Satisfactory would benefit from dinamically changing gameplay (which might be an switchable option for those who like more challenging gameplay) and ecosystem simulation (selflearning AI adaptig the difficulty to the style of playing, which might be an switchable option also; something Rimworld-like maybe).

The game runs in 64bit address space without a lags at low settings (looking great nevertheless) on my 16GB RAM laptop, with integrated GPU of i7 CPU.

Definitely recommend.

I'd highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys engineering style problems and building infrastructure.

Also, the fact that there will be more content in the future is really exciting, since I've only just unlocked nearly all of the available content in my first playthrough. Pretty sure the replay value is high on this one :)
Although there are plenty of glitches still, most of them aren't annoying. In fact, most of the glitchy things I've seen are either harmless visual glitches or ones that actually increase your freedom to build in different ways within the game! Even better, the developers acknowledge this and agree to keep those glitches which increase the enjoyability of the game.

I love building and production oriented games, so for me, this game has proven to be fantastic.
I can understand how others may not enjoy it's crafting and production focused sandbox, with limited exploration and alien killing, but for those of us who enjoy setting up networks of distribution and construction, those of us with some level of OCD where we really need to have those conveyors and pipelines lined up correctly, those of us who must continue to achieve the next level of technology to progress into a whole new set of challenges, this game is quite excellent.
I even enjoyed the time I spent taking down the nuclear production network since it was creating so very much waste and danger in parts of my map. Who knew that the process of getting rid of something I built would be fun, too?

1305,"At almost 60 hours of playtime, I've thoroughly enjoyed my time playing Satisfactory so far! In early access, even at this stage in the game it is highly playable. I haven't played Factorio but others have called this a 3D version of that game.

A lot of this game reminds me of the joys of playing Minecraft around the time it was first acquired by Microsoft. Back then, we played it on Xbox 360 and before creative mode was introduced. Like Minecraft, this game is one where you kind of have to create your own fun, in some ways.

There's isn't much of a story - you're mostly just a worker who's been tasked with mining resources and sending products out to your space homies. You have loose objectives - ""build this stuff, and then you'll be able to build this other stuff that will unlock"". Everything builds off of each other, so there's a natural progression of unlocking new components as you advance through the game to build new materials that lets you build other things.

The fun you have in this game is what you make of it, just like in Minecraft. It's a sandbox game with loose objectives and you're constantly building bigger and more efficient assembly lines to produce goods better and faster. You'll probably find that you spend an hour or so building an assembly line and then ten hours later you tear it all down and rebuild it even more efficiently than you did before, and it's never frustrating! You don't think ""meh, but that's an hour of my life I won't get back!"" You just do it and enjoy the puzzle-solving aspects of it all. And that's really what this game is... it's an open-ended puzzle game where you're finding creative solutions to get to the next objective, and the objective is what you choose it to be.

This is a really fun game. It's challenging. It's thought-provoking. It's got a ton of number-crunching behind the scenes that you can completely ignore or dive head-first into to build a better assembly. I do wish that the game had procedural generation, but that's only a minor inconvenience, and I only suggest it because there are a ton of resources for ""go here and build your base here at this spot for the best resources"" and it takes some of the fun and excitement out of the game. All in all though, if you enjoy games that feature resource management, exploration, solving creative processes, base building, light combat, and freedom to play when and how you want to, then give Satisfactory a shot!",1,2035,74.6,July 6
1306,Fun and addicting,1,33,83.6,July 6
1307,its in the name!,1,31,53.7,July 6
1308,"Honestly, one of the most addicting games that I've ever had the privilege of playing. There are quite a few pros and cons I'd like to lay out about this game. Firstly though, I'd like to note that this game is well worth the asking price, even unfinished.

Pros:
The hand crafted world is really beautiful and the ambiance draws you in completely. The animals in the world make it feel alive, and even though they are annoying sometimes, they add a new level of immersion to the game.
The game itself is beautiful, and the options to make a more naturalistic type factory or an enclosed warehouse are both there, making two, and possibly more play styles to enjoy.
On top of that, the vehicles and the fun factor in this game are really high... If you're sick of making stuff, just make a race course or skate park to play in with your friends.

Cons:
There are a lot of cons, and that's to be expected, in no way did they make me want to return the game, however.
Firstly, there is no way to equip multiple items to the body, it would make sense for some items to work together, i.e. the gas mask and the blade runner.... As these don't conflict with each other whatsoever. It would also add a whole new level of mobility as you got to higher levels. Having to switch out the jetpack and the bladerunner sometimes seems unnecessary.
There is no real functional way of snapping and locking the place of buildings in order to make them properly aligned. If you are a bit pickier about this, it might drive you crazy. You'll constantly find yourself placing buildings in the wrong spot and having to redo their placement.
I expect in a future update they will add more cosmetic furniture so you can make your own little home away from factory, so to speak, or the ability to lounge on the couch while you watch your glorious production lines from the window above.
Animal husbandry still seems like it's in its infancy, but I look forward to future updates to see what happens to that. :)

As I said, this game is amazing and the price tag justifies the content, heck, it's worth more money than I think its going for. It's still early access though, so there's a few rough patches to work out. Hope you enjoy this game as much as I do.",1,1851,261.2,July 6
1309,"Spent 9 hours straight playing, but was smiling the whole time. Be careful if you get addicted easily, particularly if you have OCD. On the other hand, this game has features to optimize your factory to the point that this game may be GREAT for someone with OCD. I will say it's a bit heavy on processing, I get about 10fps, which some would consider unplayable, but I played minecraft on 1.13.0 at 3fps so I just have ridiculously high tolerances for low fps gameplay. Honestly the games feel, especially with its soundtrack, are very reminiscent of minecraft.

1. Create planting system, planting Mycelia, Beryl Nut, Paleberry, Bacon Agaric, etc.
2. Provide more upgrades, like Water Extractor Level2, extending the length of covey belt/ wire.
3. It's hard to make high tech products, like Nuclear Pasta, Copper Powder..... WITHOUT new rewards.
At middle level of milestone, u can get many encouragement to reach higher milestone. This is essential for players to get rewards. Maybe in faster transportation (Blade Runners Level2 / airplane ) / logistic , higher capacity in storage.
4. Auto robot for building foundations.

1365,"I will be short and concise because I have neither time nor desire to write and even you who read I do not think you want to waste too much of your time.

The game is beautiful and can be played for many hours but like everything it has its pros and cons.
This review, although negative, doesn't mean ""don't buy the game"", no! But it's something to entice developers to do more!

CONs:
Some items to build have unbalanced requirements, which do not match the rest of the game. For example, the resource scanner is available in the early stages of the game, while the radio tower (technically simpler than a scanner) is unlocked much later. Or the resource extractors are unlockable in the last tier only because it's a ""new feature"" of the game, but technologically speaking they are simple like drills.
Lighting via street lamps or lights can only be unlocked via tickets while it should be something basic since the day/night cycle starts from the first minute of gameplay. Instead it is unlockable via tickets only because this is also a ""new feature"". (As if the developers were focusing more on the ""novelty"" factor than on the game mechanics).



It is still an early access game, therefore not free from bugs and lack of fundamental functions, but it is not a problem. Nothing that could spoil the gameplay too much
For example, trains, like many structures, do not have collisions. So you can go through them and build through them.
Also, there is not yet a system to release fluid such as water, you need to flow the pipes or the buffers manually. This can easy ""fix"" by edit the water pump and add an option to drain water instead of extract.





Is 30 € well spent? Yes.
Would I play it for many hours? If you're into that genre, you'll make it a lot of hours.
The game is updated in steps of months, perhaps a bit slow and the developers have the habit of taking days off for every single holiday, extending the development a lot, but in the end it is updated and I think it will be for a long time.",0,1673,143.4,July 5

1388,"So I've been playing Satisfactory for a week or so with my kids, sinking a decent amount of time into learning the game and how it works. Consider this an initial review.

The exploration side is really impressive for an early access game. The world is handcrafted and quite beautiful in places, and great fun to explore. The vehicles are fun to drive around in so far (I've only unlocked up to the truck so far - more on why later). The sound fits the ambience really well, and the graphics are smooth and clean. There are a few glitches to be found, like getting stuck in trees when you try to climb them, and the draw distance creates some really jarring pop-ins at times. I'm hopeful these will get fixed with time.

The factory/building side definitely scratches my optimisation itch, and while I'll try not to compare it to Factorio it does fill the '3D Factorio' void that I never knew I was missing. Placing production lines and tinkering with over/underclocking machines so that everything is perfectly balanced feels great and would make Thanos proud. Getting your first small factory perfectly set up and running optimally is a great feeling!

So would I recommend it? Well, no, not at this stage.

The first tiers of research can be completed more or less with just your starting HUB and a local factory. As you go up the research tiers each new item requires more production of the previous tier items, in a natural progression. Steel is where I first started to really scale up production and subsequently factory sizes, and ran into the brick wall that is factory building in Satisfactory. Everything must be placed individually. Everything. Every time.

If you're like me and you've designed a modular factory from the start, so you can just scale it easily to increase production? Nope. Every foundation, every machine, every belt and every splitter/merger/power line must be placed, one at a time, by hand. Every machine must have its recipe set individually. I'm looking at hundreds of machines, and thousands of items in total, all to be placed by hand - and I'm only in the mid-game! And heaven forfend you unlock an alternate, more efficient recipe, because then you need to tear down and redesign the factory all over again.

There are no blueprint or copy/paste planners in the game, and the Devs have said repeatedly that they won't be implementing them either, as they want every item to be hand-placed. That's fine, it is their game after all, but I definitely don't agree. There are mods available as workarounds, but I find them unreliable to use (more practice may change that).

To clarify the above, I'm not looking for a creative mode to fix this problem, though that would be nice to have regardless. What I would like is to be able to hand place a factory module, laid out perfectly, and then select it (including all of the power lines, belts, foundations as well) and build it again if I have the resources in my inventory. Exactly the same build process as now, only I'm building more than one item at a time. That's all.

So to sum up - I enjoy playing the early game, and exploring the world with my kids. But if you enjoy building large-scale factories that are efficient, and you don't have days to spend each time you need to change something, I would not recommend the game at this point.",0,2772,150.5,July 5

1419,"I MUST BE EFFICIENT
Satisfactory is a brilliant Early Access game by Coffee Stain Studios. The objective is to build a factory on an alien planet and make it as efficient as possible. The game ropes you in with a fairly straight forward tutorial and keeps things easy at the start, getting progressively more micro-managing and new as you continue to reach milestones and objectives. I did think to myself ""Why would I want to have a game where I just make a factory and create resources?"", but before I knew it, I was playing the game consistently for a while because it had me hooked. You manage power, train lines, drones, conveyor belts, it never seems to end. It has a calm feel to it, enemies don't come and ruin your factory, they just lurk about in the exploration areas and you can create weapons to defend yourself against them when you are adventuring across the huge map that is available to you. There's many different ways to build, its entirely up to you as long as you have the resources. The community behind the game is great and seeing other peoples builds gives you inspiration and it pushes creativity out of everyone. I rate Coffee Stain Studios very well for their developer updates and community interaction and can confidently say that this game is worth buying at full price even with the Early Access title attached to it. On top of all this, the game looks graphically pleasing and finds the gap where it isn't too demanding but looks good. I've played a few times with friends too and it helps to get the factories off the floor when you start a new world. The game is a gem and should be in all Steam libraries.

With my current factory, I'm near an end game point, and it's definitely dragging due to the fact I have less to focus on. The new update does help end game factories and builders by giving that new content itch, but it could do with some more to it when you're at that point. Apart from that, the game is a no brainer.",1,1622,167.0,July 4

1446,"Played the game for like 6 hours and I feel like it is an insult to the devs themselves to not play it for 100 hours. Unlike other base builder games, this game is one of if not the most satisfying base builder I have ever played. The game never encourages you to grind but rather encourages you to find ways to make that grind quicker and while doing so, you create this absolute marvel of a factory and the feeling of being proud of your work is there. Just like other base builder or ""survival"" games, this game has no end goal. One of the things that impress me so much is the fact that this is still in early access bu there are so much mechanics and new things added that I feel so happy.
To play this game properly, you should be a pretty intelligent to play it sufficiently but this game is so forgiving. They do not show you everything they got from the get go but instead throws their mechanics one at a time. This makes the game 100x more beginner friendly and the only time new mechanics will be added is if you want it to.

Doing. Nothing. You will find Satisfactory decidedly barren. In addition the possibilities for your ""factory"" like say, magically almost goofy curving conveyor belts, are so at odds with what purports to be that it is hard to stay invested even up to and concurrent with a simulator.

This review is from the perspective of someone who IS NOT big into these types of games. I tried it based on the O-positive reviews, but just didn't find the fun.

You don't need to spend forever gathering material and the crafting menu makes it very easy to make what you need. The building part of the game is just as simple and doesn't try to be overly complicated. I do wish that I had started in a more open area as the game suggested because my system is very congested.

I like the odd aliens that wander about, especially the giant potato with legs. Overall, I would highly suggest this game for the hardcore or passive gamer as it has a lot to offer and doesn't require a PhD to remember things if you drop off for a week or 4.",1,787,2.8,July 3

1486,"So, so, so, Satisfactory. Where do I begin? And where do I end? Much like a new players first attempt at a factory which lead to spaghetti, let's start at the beginning. Yknow. As any place should, I suppose!

I first learned of Satisfactory when I'd been followin' coffee stain on twitter. Big fan of sanctum and all that. Got sad it was an EGS thing, waited for it to hit steam and so it did. Bought it when I found out. So, how do I feel about it?

All in all, I think it's quite good. The music feels chill, I absolutely adore the designs in this game. They've crafted such a pretty world that is rather quite large, too. And packed it full of things to find or just nice places ot look at. And the designs of the buildings and vehicles and just.. stuff like that? It's all boxy, orange,I love it. It's great.

The actual main part, the building + factory stuff, is.. about what you'd expect I suppose! You get introduced to the basics, figure out how some things work, and things get more complicated. You find, handcraft, automate, unlock, and kinda repeat, and so it goes. Though, I think Satisfactory is a bit more easy to.. grasp? So long as you're willing to do some maths. Yknow, stuff like ""Oh hey, this uses 15. I make 30 currently. I have 120 of this, so 120 divided by 30"" and so on.

You can make some spaghetti with your conveyors or power lines but.. the game don't mind too much. Things like conveyors and pipes can clip through eachother most of the time and.. Yknow hwat? I'm okay with that. There are other factory games (which I shall not mention for many reasons) which don't let me do that. And sometimes it hurts my brain when I can't. We aren't all experts, and some of us don't wanna watch a 3 hour long video guide on how to set up the most efficient factory and take out the fun of figuring it out. I appreciate that I can break physics every now and then.

Anyway, that's the building part. So how about the rest?
It goes simple enough. You got your irons, your iron products, your copper and copper products early game, iron becomes more complicated when you need 3 things to make 3 other things that require 2 of the before mentioned thing, yknow. Stuff like that.

Then you get your coals and your irons and your steels, and your slowly but surely increasingly complicated products from it.
Other liquids get added, and byproducts from those liquids you need to plan for andadd into your increasingly complicated layouts, all that stuff. Mind, I don't think the early/mid game is that hard to work your brain around? It's when you get oils and long ra nge transport things get.. weird, to me at least.

(addendum: I forgot to add this, but to make a quick edit: Exploration is rewarded with a lot, but keep a keen eye. You find Freighters dotted about the place. Fix them up, get their harddives. Scan them at the M.A.M. and you'll be rewarded with some alt-recipes. Some of these are amazing and game changers. Love; a confused lizard)

Another thing I think benefits this, I get the feeling the people making the map were actually kinda smart. I've found several locations that are just wonderfully perfect for certain things. Find a nice lil place to make steel in the rocky desert. I got something that needs steel pipes and copper, and then I got hit by it
""Oh, ♥♥♥♥! RIGHT, MY STEEL PLACE HAS COPPER NEXT TO IT.""

I feel this game is kinda slow a lot of the time. There's a lot of periods where.. nothing is really going on? You're just kinda waiting for your machines to do the heavy lifting before you unlock the new stuff. Use those down times to explore your surroundings. Figure out where you'll source new materials, pathways to take, find slugs, find delicious carapace or organs, get terrified by the local fauna when you realise there's creepy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ spiders that spit acidic spikes at you
(or, in my case, pictures of floating cat faces that drool green slime because I have arachnophobia mode on. Yes, there is ""I'm scared of spiders"" mode that replaces them with floating cat faces. And the cats meow, instead of make the horrid skittering sound those Stingers make.)

The game gives you some movement options relatively early on if you can find them. Here's some advice, if you want it:

Oh, I forgot to mention. So you can ""Overclock"" things in this game. You unlock it early on, and they very much want you to use it. It lets you simplify, or complicate, your designs. You can find these slugs all over the place, I call them ""Friends"", and you can use them to make power shards. Plug power shards into something, and it starts working faster. Something like a screw constructor uses 10 iron rods, and a single iron rod constructor makes 15. Soo.. rather than building 2 of those and building 3 of the others, you could just make 1, overlock the other to 150% and make things less of a headache.

I think the only thing I /don't/ like about this game is the early game power. It's all handcrafted or hand found. I don't really enjoy running around, picking up leaves and wood, turning it into biomass, into solid biofuel, dumping it into biofuel burners and then getting to work and praying I work fast enough to ""out-run"" the situation where i run out of fuel and I have to spend another age cutting down trees and foliage to power the generators.

The moment you unlock coal and coal burners, this problem goes away. So my advice? Get Coal Power ASAP.

I love the movement options in this game. Anywhere from ""ride on my power line"" to ""Jump pads, baby!"" to ""I'm going to make this tube so long I will afk for 5 minutes as I get flung towards my oil by a transparent tube.""
Unfortunately, I can't tell you what I think of mid/late game, because I never made it that far. I always end up feeling terrible that I can't build right, or i just don't have the energy to figure it out. But just because I get sad about it, doesn't mean you shouldn't check Satisfactory out if it catches your fancy.

Just remember, if you're struggling to figure it out.. just take a step back. Take a few breaths, and just go ""Alright, let me break this down in my head.""

And remember, if you need space, platforms are your friend. No room? Build up. FICSIT encourages verticality to streamline short range transportation. But they also defy physics, and if you want you could just make a floating sky factory on platforms.

1493,"I'm a 1000 hours in, and still playing.

If you like base building, balancing production lines, and minor scrapes of combat to mix things up, then this is a good game to lose track of time playing.

Beautiful hand placed world, plenty of exploration the first few go arounds and I'm still discovering things I haven't seen before here and there.

Combat is limited, not a focal point to the game at all, but still something to get the heart racing at times.

Very chill, there's never a running clock, get done what you do when you do. Milestones along the way reward you for progress with new recipes/gear/buildings etc.

Multiplayer is a bit wonky, only real drawback atm. It isn't as plug and play as the rest of the game but it's getting better and some have more luck with it than others.

So if you like the way that sounds, snag the game.",1,715,1066.9,July 3
1494,"Update after 126 h:

One of the best games I've played in many years, it's the only game which returns the game experience of the ancient Transport Tycoon (TTD) game from the 90s. The setting up of conveyor belts and controlling input-output is pretty much like the railway construction in that old classic but in 3D, plus you unlock trains in midgame. Because of this the game has as much replay value as it too because you can always find new ways to accomplish what you want.

TTD didn't have any objectives and still was fun and so is Satisfactory, although there is no money in Satisfactory but TTD didn't have a tier progression system.

Game is good as it is, anything extra is a bonus in terms of new updates. The fun factor increases the more you progress in the game compared to many games that stagnate midgame, if you find the beginning to be fun then expect it to be uberfun later on. If you find the very beginning to be dull with manual harvest for fueling biomass generators please be patient and unlock coal power as soon as possible as then electricity generation becomes automated then and you almost don't have to do much manual labor anymore other than building structures and crafting some handheld equipment.

There is at least one annoying bug but it isn't game breaking except that I lost an Explorer vehicle that went underground more than once (which I recovered via some 3rd party tool). Some building blocks have issues to snap in place properly such as the walkway ramps. The AI drivers which follow recorded routes can be a bit crazy, don't stand in their way because they don't care if you or your vehicle are there and they tend to get stuck if you don't plan their routes very carefully (which may lead to them going out of fuel somewhere so you need to go on a rescue mission).

Original review:

The game is interesting for players who would like a focus on the engineering part of construction games, because you build your own industry on an alien planet and are responsible for resource gathering (via automatic miners very early), electricity production and managing various kinds of machines like constructors and assemblers to manufacture components which can be used to place new structures or finish progression tiers.

You start off with quite a bit of micromanagement which can become automated eventually as you progress, and it can be annoying to fill machines like biofuel manually, but as you progress machines can handle it and it's not too much of a nuisance. Micromanagement will always involve setting up and changing production queues and making sure you have enough juice so a fuse won't blow.

The game lacks a real purpose for your industry, like an economy, which other reviews have also highlighted and is something the developer could work on, however I understand it's an alpha game so I'm not loudly criticizing them. But the tier system of progression keeps you occupied for hours and it's unfair to whine too much about it.

The challenge of the game is to make your industry more efficient like prevent machines from causing delays to other machines, maximize the output, and so you don't have to do things by hand, for example move things manually between machines, which can be a challenge. A lot of the stuff can be automated if you set it up properly.",1,2768,241.5,July 3

1532,"It's great if you like pretending to be an engineer, mechanic, explorer, etc. I bought the game for $23.99 and I believe it's worth it. I have been having a blast the first 10+ hours, and can't wait to play some more tomorrow. Very polished for early access, I became glued to the floor once in the 10+ hours I played and just loaded a recent auto-save to undo it. The only other down side I hope they improve upon is that the game only has one hand made map, which limits replay-ability. The game is unfinished but I am still putting in many hours. I am running out of new things to do, so hopefully they add some more content soon. As I have been playing, I have noticed many clipping issues with getting stuck on certain aspects of the terrain, and I have to load an auto-save most times to fix it, I lose a little bit of time when it happens, but it doesn't happen all the time, but it is annoying when it does happen. The auto-save is similar to Valheim, in it causes you to lag briefly when flying with the jetpack, and has caused me to get injured a few times. I have found items that do not have a use yet, but I am hanging onto them for now. There are also items I find (sprites I guess) that are hovering/floating in the air, which ruins some of the immersion. That's all I can say for now. I do not particularly like using the scroll wheel to cycle through my gear in my belt, it takes too long and does not seem to follow a predictable order and when you need a certain weapon or other item quickly, it is not reliable at all, there should be a hot bar or quickbar for you weapons like you have for building parts etc.",1,1330,196.7,July 3

I played this game but I had to get a refund.

It seems to be a really good game, primarily graphically for its genre. For this game, I think that XBOX Controller support would be awesome.

Its basically a AAA Factorio but not as complex in terms of production chains and is more relaxed. Less combat but more exploration.

1613,"This game is pretty great. I found it first when watching Let's Game It Out, but there's much more you can do with this game than what he shows you in his videos. You'll definitely start off with a more sloppy factory, but once you get the hang of the game, you can make a better one somewhere else on the map. Speaking of, the maps for this game are great, they may be dangerous a bit, but they are quite good looking. If you want a factory game, this will be the best one you can find around.

TL;DR it's worth paying for, and even more fun with friends, but playable by oneself.",1,487,18.1,July 1
1614,"Incredibly fun and I've had many amazing moments so far. I've gotten to T6 so my feedback will be from that experience.

Visuals - 9/10
Audio - 9/10
Mechanics - 7/10
Gameplay elements: 5/10

WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD

Feedback on mechanics and gameplay elements:

+ Building with conveyors and lifts is incredibly fun. You can make some really wacky factories and setups.

+ Removing and adding structures is fast and versatile. Well done on that end.

- There's only one ""body"" slot. You can't wear more than one of for example blade runners, jetpack nor the gas mask. Switching between these is incredibly annoying and frequently disrupts the gameplay.

- Machines cannot tilt one bit. Building in slopes is awkward.

- It's not feasible to elevate machines/foundations to a desired height without an anchor point from somewhere else and even with that, they'll either be floating in the air or standing on foundations from the ground.

- It'd be great if you could swap the input/outputs for machines which have both fluids and items, like the refinery. It's more or less a symmetry/design thing and irrelevant for mechanics.

- Alternative recipes often don't make sense. For example, Caterium Ingots can give Copper Wire, they are two different materials and it makes no sense. It's great that core resources can be produced in much higher quantities later on. Maybe there could be dynamic recipes instead.

- Conveyor belts require no power and seemingly run from nothing. Some nodes can be kilometers from your main base and transporting these via conveyor belts is taxing on game performance. Trains is an option but they're incredibly power consuming, especially when you need them around T5-6.

- There's a lack of variety for arsenal. I would love to see something like a bow or crossbow.

- More often than not you'll encounter the same enemies, i.e fire/acid spitting dinosaurs, charging dinosaurs, the airborne stingers and/or spiders and they all exist in every biome.

- There's only 4 types of healing items, deez nuts, bacon things, berries and the medical item.

1729,"Greetings.

I would very much recommend this game for anyone who loves factory-type games and exploration, and doesn't mind some very minor combat. (Also, you should probably make sure your computer can run it.)

When I first got this game, I was playing on a computer with integrated radeon graphics (if you are not a nerd, basically I was playing on a potato). I had about 6 fps on ultra low settings, More on that later. After a couple months on that, I switched to a computer with a Ryzen 7 4000H Processor and a GTX 1650 ti with 16 gb of ram. With those specs, I am currently able to run a decently sized factory at 60 fps on Ultra Settings. This has made the game much more enjoyable, but I never hated it even when it was running at 6 fps. This is because I love the core gameplay elements this has to offer. My favorite part is going from nothing to hand-crafting to a small unorganized factory to a better and bigger factory to many factories around the world to a whole network of factories working together just to make over 50 turbo-motors per minute.

Here's how it works: You select a place (I would suggest the green hills just because it is very easy to start in). Then, you find your first node (usually of iron). Then, you start hand-picking at that thing until you can create a way to do that automatically. But, iron ore isn't very useful. You need to craft it into something, so now you are sitting at the crafting bench, waiting for your iron to be made into something else when you say, ""I should really automate this."" And after that, once you set up a production chain, you can go explore, and when you come back, you will have bins full of materials. You then just keep going. It never really gets boring. You can either make super efficient factories capable of making a TON of items per minute, or you can make a less efficient factory that works okay, but wastes a lot of time and materials. But it is really up to you, and how you choose to play.

Power is also fun. When you start out, you are having to feed these biomass burners with leaves and sticks in order to keep power, but then, you unlock coal power, fuel power, geothermal power, and then (spoiler) ! And that last one is complicated to say the least, but by that point, you'll be ready for it.

The map is huge. Though it is finite, it never feels like it. Yes, I have seen the edge of the map, but it is nothing to be concerned about. You will never run out of room to build a base.

There is some mild combat to the game, but it's nothing much. If you go exploring and you are un-equiped for the area, then it might be a challenge. But throughout the game, you will be able to upgrade your weapons to make it even easier.

Mods! Unfortunately, there is no built-in support for Mods in Steam, but they are possible, you just need to download Satisfactory Mods Manager via their website online, so once you do that, it's not a very big deal. There are three types of mods in my opinion: one, the game-breaking types that some might like, but I don't. Two: The types that are game-breaking if you abuse them, but can be helpful if you just don't want to take time going to your storage room. Lastly, there is the third type which are useful mods that just make life easier. With the right combination, mods can either make a playthrough more enjoyable, or just mix things up if you are playing again.

I, myself, have not quite finished one playthrough, but I'm close. And when I do, I'll just start over and instead take a different approach in automating every item in the game. I don't think I'll be bored for a while at least.

So, again, I highly recommend this game if you like factory-type games and exploring. Again, the combat is not too bad, and the game is very optimized . But apart from that, just a couple of tips for you if you do decide to buy this:

1) Just build a storage room, guys. It makes it all easier.
2) The second you unlock Hypertubes, USE THEM, and put them all around your base.
3) Overclock as many miners as possible. You can build infinite machines, but there are limited resource nodes.
4) Just because a line's materials isn't moving doesn't mean you can just split that line and take whatever you need; that might be supporting a production chain that is just not currently in use and all backed up.
5) Don't forget about research! It is useful.
6) Build a starting factory that is messy, then, leave your computer running for a couple of hours. Then, come back, and then use those resources that were just generated to build your new, permanent factory.
7) Trains are cool, but too many of them start to lag, so be careful. (I am unsure about drones)

1737,EARLY ACCESS REVIEW,1,17,3.3,June 29
1738,"I enjoyed my time with the game, animations are great and the aesthetics are great, there is plenty to do and exploration is generally pretty fun. The enemies can be a little frustrating to fight however.

The only thing I didn't like was around tier 8 the ratios of components became very tedious, with some items taking 4 or 5 assemblers worth of expensive items. Up to that point the game was amazing so I would say its very worth playing.",1,381,91.0,June 29
1739,"Yeah so about this game, you're wasting time reading reviews, you could be starting your first factory, but if you wish.

This game is possibly the best $24 dollars I have spent on a game. I can't stop playing it, I catch myself constantly thinking about how to improve the flow or make it look even cooler!
I have turned the ENTIRE desert into a glass terrarium-Factory, a factory in/on a terrarium **** IDK its awesome, it still wont lag or break.

There is so much to research, there is so much to explore, build and do. I can not stress to you the level of fun and SATISFACTION we are getting from this game. It is very rewarding and keeps your wanting to hit your next goal. There is a problem I get distracted because there is so much I want to do in the game. No limits I have found yet.

This is taking too long I must get back to my factory,I promise it will not let you down. Feel free to add me I'd love to help you get started, this much fun should be shared!

- Can I replay this game? You will enjoy many many hours.

- How is the satisfactory community? Well, They are the best !

- How are the graphics and how does the game run? The graphics are amazing, the game runs very smooth. It is in early access but the Devs are working very hard, it runs much better than what they say, which is good news for us, that means its going to be as close to perfect as they can.

- Are the Devs actively working on the game I see it has been in early access a while? They are the most interactive development studio I have had dealings with, you should tune in on Tuesday to watch the dev stream on Twitch. Jayce is quitting real soon but someone will be there.

- Would you recommend this game? All joking aside from earlier in my review, totally, this is a game that will give you hours and hours of fun. I have bought this for several friends and strangers, this game is so good it draws you in, you will want to share it with everyone.

- I read in reviews multiplayer is broken, is this true? No, this is an absolute untruth. Multiplayer works very well, and far better than the Devs give themselves credit for. The problem with multiplayer that you have read about in other reviews, is in the chair of the reviewer. Enjoy multiplayer as well, Play this game how you like.",1,1870,336.6,June 29

This game is like spore/minecraft/factorio maybe..

I can't think of any other way to describe this game, it is the most SATISFYING game I have played in almost all of my gaming career!

1752,"Yeah. Buy this game. Phenomenal. <3

Things I'd love to see later on if any of the devs read these reviews!

1. A scanner that can be used to scan creatures/objects/items, provide little tidbits of info when you scan them, and have a progression system for it, the more stuff you scan, the more little rewards you can get, that kinda thing, like in No Man's Sky, I LOVE that system and I feel like this small thing would benefit this game a lot.

2. More weapons, I'm sure there will be more, as this is still considered early access..but I'm just saying~

3. No map limits, if we can see it, we should be able to go there. I don't like seeing the edge of the world, makes the map feel a little small. >.<

4. A more active enemy system, options to build turrets for base defense, spikes, bigger walls, gates, that kinda stuff. Having my base in the middle of a field with no threats to it on an alien planet definitely doesn't feel right, in my honest opinion. I know the game is more centered on building, and people may like having a peaceful environment, but adding difficulty options at least, like peaceful/hostile environments would awesome, kindof like how the Valheim enemy system works. :)

5. A radio that we can load songs into somehow so we can listen to some tunes as we build and explore!

6. Player housing, nothing massive, just a personal little house you can decorate! Would mean a lot.

7. Let us sleep in beds/sit on chairs. :>

8. Minigames on the computer within the HUB? Just a thought!

9. Let us climb the space elevator. >=(

Nonetheless, amazing game. Still having fun and doing my own thing, amazing stuff!",1,1366,20.4,June 29

1755,"Game not bad at all, but i have a lot experience in this kind of games and love them but saw much much better.
Problems:
1) Oversize buildings - Early start game when game asking you to build space elevator... Bigger then my screen Assemblers, Furnace, constructors etc.... Only Hub have normal size in game over player size. Why they can't split mega building in to few pieces. And build them step by step...
2)Base building turns into torture due to the huge dimensions of buildings. You need build large platform in air for hold start base. Ramps don't have base soo it's looks like UFO. Walking simulator around you base.
3) Tech tree - Game at the beginning requires you to explore world search for power slugs. Ability to fly open at tier 6.... Walk around map and build conveyer belts everywhere such an awesome idea.
4)Сollision - game have a lot problems with it. Belts, pipes cross each other it's looks terrible for this sort of game. Spaghetti. Hello Factorio o/ <3<3<3
Same problem with Flora if you build building game not destroying trees & bushes. Tree in the middle of assembler looks rerrible.
5)Energy management. Last few years in base building games i see same problem. People who make this probably have no idea how electricity works. Thin copper wire that powers the entire base. Also beginning phase power poles have just 4 connections. in, out and 2 connections... Pole forest !
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This game don't have almost anything similar to Factorio BUT it's pretty bad copy of 2 mods for minecraft
GregTech 5+MineFactoryReloaded.
Gregtech 5 mod for my opinion still the best TechBaseBuilding simulator in 3d. Satisfactory atm have max 10% of it's content.
13hours in this game to 10k hours in Gregtech4 of nonstop building and planning (Automatization of Oil refinery blow your mind).
(I rly give up to wait, soo last few hours played x20 Cheat Engine boost just for see what have tier 5-6 elevator.)

If they make multiblock structures similar like have Gregtech addon GT++ allowing to build your self multi structures and decided where to build imput, outupt, energy, fluid hatches it's can change general feeling of game. Also decreese basic machines size at least to 6x6 based on ramps size 8x8.
Game not worth to play atm. Let's see how it's gona be in relese. But probably no!",0,2011,13.2,June 29

1769,"Amazing factory building game with good graphics. The visuals remind me of No Man's Sky. There aren't really any survival elements to the game which is enjoyable and allows you to focus on just the building. It is easy to get lost in the game for hours since the pacing is good and you can go from one goal onto the next very easily. Later in the game it becomes more difficult to do things solo as the amount of work increases exponentially, but it is still very fun. I'm excited to see how the next update improves the game even further.",1,456,32.3,June 29

First things first, this game is beautiful. Coffee Stains Studio should be so proud of the stunning and captivating environments they've been able to produce! Whether you're under the heat of a vast and sparse desert, or relaxing on the coast line underneath an alien tree, you're going to find something to love in this game.

Secondly, the game play is nearly perfect. Sure, there are some areas of the map that you might wander into that lead to a dead end (or in a couple of cases me falling through the map) but those instances make up 0.00000000000001% of your game play experience. Coffee Stain Studios have truly perfected the Open-World-Survival Sim theme and executed it in the most satisfactory (hehe) way possible.

There are flaws as the game is still developing, it will be not as smooth as the host for those who are joining the server.
Like, the plants that had been chopped down will reappear and wouldn't go away for those who are joining. But, for the host that area is actually cleared.

Oh btw ~ this game is not storyline intensive, so do take note on that.

1876,This game is..... Satisfactory,1,45,7.7,June 27
1877,I played this very briefly when it first hit the steam store on a friend's PC and resolved to give it some space. Now that it is a little more fleshed out I must say this is a solid foundation for a what is shaping up to be a very neat little game. Can't beat the 5GB size for all the fun little moments as what you seek is suddenly being obscured by a pack of face-hungry manta rays that shoot fireballs and have legs.,1,353,30.4,June 27
1878,"A very fun game. It's pretty addicting from the start. Every aspect is fun, but it'll always be a bit tough at the start. I recommend playing with friends, as playing solo can feel lonely when you have all that open space to explore and build upon.",1,220,72.4,June 27
1879,"Warning! If you would like to have a safe and healthy life by not having a video game direct your life, then this isn't the game for you; it is that addicting in my opinion.

I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes to watch machines work for them and just loves automation. There really isn't much more that I can say about this game; it is that good.

Just within the first 2 days of owning this game, I have never felt a feeling of such satisfaction by playing a video game and branching out an industry of large proportions. I hate grindy games, but this game gives a sense of high accomplishment for doing grindy tasks.

For anyone familiar with Minecraft Modpacks that revolve around anything technology based, this isn't like anything you've seen; it is actually fun to build machines and automation processes without hassel of having to beat around some other bush to gather materials for one simple machine.

If anyone has played NMS, this game gives a vibe with it, but with its own creative spin. No stupid Alchemic processes of turning X into Y, then Y into Z, no dumb story that makes you run around like a headless chicken, and no stupid power required to actually run storage systems.

As a closing to this cluster review, I believe the best characteristic of this game that gives it such a good feeling of progression is that you really don't need any walk-through's, wiki's, or a discussion site to actually play the game. You can still use these sources, but you rarely will need them; I've only gotten stuck once and needed Wiki help for obtaining an item.",1,1323,51.7,June 27

1922,"This game has a bunch of random mechanics that are fun individually , but as a factory building sim I can't say that it's really that great. Honestly, Factorio is just a better factory construction game and feels more gratifying to play, this game really doesn't hit the same notes. Whenever I finish some part of my factory in this game I just think ""Thank Gaben that's been dealt with"" rather than ""What's next?"" like Factorio. The game has no core drive for me, it doesn't really feel fun to build new facets of my factory, it just feels like a chore. The infinite resources means there's no conflict to drive you forward and build elsewhere, you just build and then let it sit on it's own for 5 Hours until you finally reach the next research threshold and can move on to... doing the exact same thing, again... ... It's really not that great, especially since I'm comparing it to a Titan like Factorio.

I hope this game can improve in the future, as individually its parts are fun, but as a whole... It's definitely less than the sum of its parts...

If u like optimization, reflection and farm, this game is made for you.
Difficulty level is perfect, not too easy, not impossible, but u need to use your brain though.
You got the desire to progress, and many fetures make the game more pratical conserning recipes and needs.
There is frequent update during this early access.
Multiplayer has a few issues, and there is of course bugs in this game, But none of them prevents you from playing and enjoying.
The only problem is that the map always the same, so it reduce the lifetime of this game, one game last for 100h before being really complete, but you can change start biomes to discover another part of this beautiful game.

Ok, so i build the HUB, and i created a fully automated factory, and i made a bunch of power core stuff. (all of this in 3 hours...Speedrun?) And i build all that stuff. EVEN A HUGE TRAIN STATION AREA AND STUFF!!! But after all that, i just wanted a break and build stuff freely. i looked around in the code and game of Satisfactory, and there is no creative mode.

2022,A great game for people who like automation games which need you to spend hours trying to make everything streamline. The game also has got its challenges like when you have the animals which want to kill you when you are going into their areas but that also adds to the game's challenge and makes you think about how to get around them. Another aspect of the game which makes it challenging is the power management and how you have to make sure you have enough power for what you want to do and if you have enough resources to make the power stations work so you have enough power. This game is very well made and I would advise people who like these types of games to get this one.,1,571,19.3,June 25

2060,"This has potential to be a great game. Subnautica meets Factorio, what's not to like? There are many things the devs have done right, and a few that need work, but for an early access game, it's definitely a recommendation from me.

What works:
- Visuals are great.
- Factory building is very enjoyable, the models are simply amazing and the core systems are fun.
- Technology progression feels rewarding so far.
- Exploration is surprisingly good for a factory-building game. The decision to avoid procedurally generated maps and go for a few hand-crafted worlds is the right one here, and the maps are fantastic, although rather small. They are interesting to explore and invoke a sense of wonder.
- Surprisingly few glitches for early access. Aside from some placeholder items here and there, I wouldn't be able to tell right away that it's not a finished product.

What needs work:
- The major issue that bugs me personally is complete lack of an end-game goal. Without something to look forward to the game feels pointless. This is subjective, but I prefer my sandbox games to give me something big to work towards, even if it's superficial like in Minecraft. Maybe I've missed something, but I'm halfway through the technology tree and I still have no clue why I'm building all this stuff. Bugs the hell out of me.
- Balance needs some work. E.g., until you hit the coal power (which is pretty late if you don't know what you're doing in advance), power management is a major hassle as you're forced to constantly cut trees for fuel, which feels like a grind. In a way, it's good that the game forces you to do it early on to encourage exploration, but to my taste it does it too much.
- Buildings placement in 3D is fiddly. I think something like easily adjustable snap-to-grid scale setting would be very useful.
- For a game of complex flowsheet management it lacks the tools to visualize it. I'd love to see some in-game screens that would allow to understand what is not working at a glance.
- Lack of some kind of blueprint system to allow for simpler base expansion. This is a highly requested feature, which as I understand the devs are not keen on implementing. It doesn't bother me too much personally, but I know many people suffer without it.

Mind you, none of these issues prevent me from having a ton of fun with this game.",1,1958,92.3,June 24

It is clearly not a finished game, there are ingredients that have no uses, areas where performance needs improvement and lots of little issues here and there. But all of that is so easy to ignore as you start building and growing your factories and regular patching and updates gives a great indication these issues will be resolved as the game heads towards a full release version.

Cannot recommend this game enough, loving it.",1,451,1292.8,June 24
2090,It's a factory building game like Factorio. In contrast to Factorio this game has a fully realized 3D world and this is a problem. The main game loop revolves around building various factory elements and the 3D world makes it difficult and tiresome to build those. In the 2D world of Factorio the act of lining up the buildings or removing swaths of constuction elements is easy and here it's a chore. You will spend some time designing your factory and a lot of time trying to align a conveyor belt against a constructor or something like that. The 3D nature of the world and FPS aspect of the game make it very unpleasant experience.,0,539,10.9,June 24
2091,"Game is incredibly addicting. Completing one portion of your factory unlocks new potential for more and more lines, which then double back and allow you to work on building the efficiency of your already existing line. Game has got a bit of jank on it, but nothing game breaking, just some goofy clipping and materials in game that have no use (which helpfully tell you they have no use as of yet). Movement feels very good, problem solving results in satisfying conclusions. A great big world to explore and so much iron to mine. I can see myself spending hundreds of more hours into this, and the devs seem to be actively working on more content.

2129,"There are times where I absolutely hate this game. The random frame rate hiccups have lead to my death (multiple times). Once you get past a certain sized base, the game can really start to chug (to the point of unplayable). I have also encountered a weird glitch where when I exit the game, the game doesn't actually shut down. It continues to run in the back ground, and I cannot shut it down without restarting Steam.

Then there are SO many parts of the game I love. Everything is your creation. Whether your base works or fails it's all on you. And it feels SO GOOD to have your plans and designs work. It's a wonderful and addicting gameplay loop. The updates are regular and often substantial. The atmosphere is great, and the world can feel foreboding and mysterious.

This game can endlessly piss me off, but I have so much fun with it, I'm more than willing to put up with the issues, and I feel like the developers will get this game finished and polished.

In short, there are points where I pause, look at the world and what I've created, and think ""Wow. I can't believe this is still in early access."" And then my character gets stuck in a rock and I think ""Oh yea. This game is in early access.""

Set your expectations appropriately, and you will have a good time.",1,1065,287.4,June 23
2130,"Do you have OCD?
Yes: Well you'll love this game because tediously designing, micromanaging, min/maxing, adjusting and readjusting your factory will satisfy even the most meticulous of people.
No: Don't worry, the game is forgiving enough/free enough to allow for total spaghettification of your designs... just don't expect it to be easy to find things down the line.

Do you like stunning visuals?
Yes: Well you're in luck, complete with beautiful scenery, high texture quality, and even lense flare this game is graphically quite stunning.
No: mmm IDK, try Minecraft maybe?

Do you like active combat?
Yes: Well this probably isn't the game for you, there is PVE combat, and you could even say it's virtually essential to progress in the game, it isn't the core intention of the game, there are things to kill yes (as mentioned things you pretty much have to kill, yes), and there are melee and firearms, but not many, and none are particularly powerful and satisfying to a violence addict.
No: See above, you will need to fight things most likely, I can't imagine a method of play that doesn't involve killing some creatures, but don't worry, you aren't going to be on a battlefield.

Do you like Spiders?
Yes: Oh good! Then you'll love the caves...
No: Well no worries, you can turn them into.... kittens? Nasty, mean little kittens...

Overall:
Game directive: Creative building and design, encourages creative engineering to build a factory capable of achieving several goals.
Rating: A+ for visual qualities, beautiful scenery, realistic machinery, most graphical elements of this game are top notch.
Rating: A for Control interface/User Interface, although most things are relatively intuitive and movement feels smooth, dynamic, and predictable, there are some aspects of the controls that aren't exactly well explains, such as stack splitting, etc... honestly just look up the controls, it's not Arma 3 complicated or anything, but there are a few controls that the average user may not even know exist.
Rating: A+ for depth of gameplay, honestly you can sink easily over 500 hours into a single factory and still not be fully ""satisfied"" (although personally I only get about 50 hours into a factory before my ADD kicks in and I move on to something else, but I come back repeatedly)
Rating: A for replayability, there is only 1 map, but the map is in all honesty, absolutely huge, there are 4 main starting locations and with some hiking you can choose your own starting location by just breaking down your escape pod and walking for a bit, however there are probably some places that will be difficult if not impossible to use as a start location due to 1: impassible terrain until later in the game, 2: potential baddies between you and where you want to go and/or 3: access to basic resources that are definitively required for progress on nearly any level of the game. To be frank I have restarted the game 4 times and loaded into all but 1 of the 4 starting areas (I visited the other one in one of my previous games and it's a bit creepy there, so I don't want to live there...) and despite restarting the game that many times I have yet to traverse the whole map, but the developers did do a great job of gently encouraging you to visit other areas by spreading out end-game resources.
Early Access Rating: A+ (some may not share this view), as opposed to releasing frequent yet unimpressive updates the developers have chosen to use large scale updates less often, they roll bug fixes quite regularly, but full feature updates are generally fewer in number, but great in overall addition to the gameplay. As far as the state of the game goes I have to say every aspect of the game that is in play right now feels finished minus a few odd items here and there (the odd thing that doesn't have sound attached to it for example, like construction of a vehicle), but otherwise the playable elements of the game right now, feel complete and well polished. We're so used to ""Early Access"" games being a catch all phrase for under developed and unfinished crap with no curb appeal or at the very least several massively game breaking bugs, Satisfactory is not one of those games.

2139,"Pros:
-good graphics
-well designed maps, beautiful + no out of place clipping etc.
-amazing game play, especially if you're mechanically inclined.
-very easy to setup multiplayer, was able to jump right in with no issues.
-no major bugs or glitches that I've had to experience yet.

Cons:
-not very many different maps, which I would assume can cause game play to eventually stagnate. [Edit] At the time of making this I didn't realize there was only one map. But I see now that it is a large single map, with many possibilities. So if it's a negative or not is in the eye of the beholder.

Maybe could add variants of ore etc. to add a splash of variation to the game, but other than that I can't think of anything I dislike.

Overall, I think this game provides a mechanically/statistically challenging environment in a way that still offers the relaxation and entertainment of playing a video game you enjoy. Would definitely recommend. 8.5/10",1,810,111.1,June 23

2193,"It is a high quality game but Factorio is its' superior in quality and technicality. Satisfactory is good if you played a lot of Factorio and want something new otherwise stick with or play that game. Because of the inclusion of the 3rd dimension building something as simple a conveyor belt can have a lot of depth in comparison to Factorio but as a tradeoff it is much more sluggish and tedious especially at first. Progression in this game is slow and not incredibly gratifying in comparison to Factorio where even early on it feels rewarding to get machines to work in this it is just connect the dots. They put too much emphasis on the later stages of the game.

A really unfortunate part of this game however is the performance problems, framerate can dip from time to time but mainly I mean the poor performance when playing online with friends. If two people living a few blocks from each other with really great internet and decent systems can't even walk around without horrific latency you have a problem. It is unacceptable how poorly this stuff works. For some reason as well your character is saved on the cloud so if for whatever reason you try to play your world when you are offline you will find your inventory is wiped and vise versa. It thinks online you and offline you are two different characters which is beyond stupid.

So in short play Factorio instead unless you played all you can of that game and want something new.",1,1207,9.2,June 22

2219,"Satisfactory is a game that appears to be a direct descendant of Factorio, in that the primary challenge and the main point of the game is to create factories and supply lines between them that would wring the planet out of its natural resources and turn them into technological products that you need to create more sophisticated factories, more efficient supply lines, and more cool gadgets for personal use. On that front, Satisfactory delivers while still being in deep Early Access, there's hundreds of hours of content.

What puts it apart from other similar games, by which I mostly mean Factorio, is that Satisfactory puts you in the first-person perspective in a very gorgeous and vertical world. There are so many hidden nooks and crannies to find while scaling monumental mountains with waterfalls falling into the mist below. The real joy of Satisfactory comes from its movement: by creating the gargantuan machine of your factory, you create an environment for yourself to traverse, and boy is it ever a joy to traverse it. Electric ziplines, exoskeletons, parachutes, and jetpacks are all valuable additions to your character, who gets to bullet jump like in Warframe and slide under conveyor belts. It is so far removed from the central point of the game, but the game would be so much worse off if it wasn't included. If you're reading this, you probably know all about the factory-building aspect, but there is a lot more to this game than conveyor belts and iron plates.",1,1257,22.4,June 21
2220,"This game has been on my radar for a bit. There was no way in hell I was going to buy it during its Epic exclusivity period, so I waited for the Steam release. While the game is still in early access, it's certainly more feature complete than a majority of other titles in that category can boast.

Anyway, what do I think? It's good; addictive. It's easy to come across production issues and have to problem-solve around them to squeeze maximum efficiency out of your setups. It's also common to find yourself tumbling down rabbit holes of exponentially expanding production possibilities. For example, I went into a rebuild of my current manufacturing base, expecting only to increase steel and component throughput. I'm now finding myself demolishing everything in that base because I realized I wasn't maximizing my miners. It's opened up a ridiculous list of ways my production efficiency is about to increase, and I'm not even optimal yet.

If you like to obsess over details and squeeze every single bit of efficiency out of things, this game will likely not disappoint you.",1,918,83.8,June 21

2289,"About the game in the game description on Steam,

""Satisfactory is a first-person open-world factory building game with a dash of exploration and combat. Play alone or with friends, explore an alien planet, create multi-story factories, and enter conveyor belt heaven!""

If this even peaks your interest, just buy the game. Progressing to the next tier feels so exciting and brings factory defining changes to the game. Unlock new tier, see what is going to make it 10x better and more efficient, get excited and scrap your current factory to build a bigger one!

The game is so satisfying! If you have a sliver of OCD, you will drain countless hours making the perfect factory where everything has the tightest turns.

Buy the damn game....",1,639,113.2,June 20

2307,This game is super fun to play if you like base building and the terrain looks great. My only problem with this game is that the performance is not very optimized. If your going to be building large structures your game is going to lag and or crash. The minimum system requirements are not nearly enough to play the game. In the minimum system requirements section they said that you need to have a 2G graphics card to play the game. I have a 4G graphics card and my game doesn't look like a game. It looks like a slideshow of pixels moving across my screen so if you're going to play this you're going to need a beefy graphic card for your experience to run smoothly.,1,560,544.5,June 19

This makes your base a MUCH, MUCH bigger and very cumbersome to try to lay out in a way that is reasonably functional and navigable... I would LOVE to see that particular requirement altered to allow a MINIMUM of 2 functional buildings ran from each power plant (preferably 4 or more), especially when it comes to the ""In-line"" pumps. They are small enough we should be able to hook 5 or 10 of those to a single power source. Multiple electrical connections are the norm EVERYWHERE else! Why not here?

2416,"Satisfactory is such a fun game that I always find myself coming back to. Anyone who likes factory games such as Factorio will probably love Satisfactory as well. Unlike many factory building games, Satisfactory is first person, making it even more satisfying to step back and watch as your factories grow. The main gamplay of building your factory and advancing your technology is very fun, because you can put in the time to carefully plan out your factory and make it look clean and organized, without it becoming overly tedious. On top of factory building, Satisfactory also has an element of world exploration which can serve as a nice break if you want to focus on something other than building factories for a while. The world exploration is well done because it allows you to explore the rather large map and see all the interesting and beautiful biomes, while also getting Hard Drives which give you valuable alternate recipes for your production lines. On top of the fun core gameplay, Satisfactory can also be played in singleplayer or multiplayer. I find the game to be fun in singleplayer, but even more fun if a couple of friends join your world. One thing to note is that if you join a multiplayer game you often experience more bugs than in singleplayer, but these bugs are almost never game-breaking and can normally be fixed by rejoining the world. Also, the game is still in early access and is quite smooth considering it is not fully released. Satisfactory also seems to never get old. I have put many hours into the game and still plan to put in many more. I constantly think about future factory plans and have loved every second of playing the game. In all, Satisfactory is a very fun and satisfying factory game that I would recommend to anyone who already likes factory games, or to anyone who hasn't played a factory game and wants to try out the genre.",1,1568,291.0,June 16
2417,"Satisfactory is an excellent game for people who like building bases. It's all about building.
Having said that, I must say the world is gorgeous. It's an alien planet with multiple moons and a day-night cycle. There's lots of terrain to explore in search of raw materials and some local fauna to battle for control of territory, though combat is only a small part of the game.
The interface is also very good. There's something intuitive about pointing where you want to build something then seeing all the materials fly from your person to that spot and assemble the building in seconds. It just feels right.
The focus is always on building your factories bigger and better. Rerouting the endless streams of conveyor belts to be more efficient and watching them march long lines of materials across the landscape to be gobbled up by your ever-hungry factories. Ship your products off to your overseers in space to unlock more building schematics then build your factories bigger and better than before.",1,856,276.8,June 16
2418,"This game is very fun and extremely ""satisfactory"". Most of this game is not in completing challenges, but in creating more efficient and beautiful factories. This is where the gameplay shines as you have to figure out what is holding back your machines and rebuilding time and time again to keep up with your resource demand.

I highly recommend this game to anyone who wants an amazing base builder and a lot of extra hours to put into it.

The only thing I can say against this game is the lack of optimization for multiplayer and the lack of being able to run a dedicated server. But from what I hear, these issues are being worked on (even if they are not the highest priority).",1,579,134.3,June 16

You just automate and craft so you can get more milestones so you can automate and craft more.

2429,"Originally, I refunded the game for its network issues, despite my deep love of the studio. Network is much better, great progression. The game punishes you a little for being too forward in exploration, but its not unreasonable. Very satisfactory.",1,227,21.7,June 16

2433,"This game is a really fun and addictive automation factory-builder. The combat and exploration elements are pretty basic but kinda fun. There are some issues with scalability - there's no functioning blueprint system for example like factorio has, which means you end up spending a lot of time building big rows of production buildings and individually hooking up each one to input, output, and power. But I got a LOT of fun out of this game before this really started to bother me. I will also say that the hand-built map, while beautiful, limits replayability. It's quite unbalanced in terms of resource locations too. There is a particular spot that is essentially the objectively best place to start your factory to avoid having to make massive long-range transportation lines, so if you want to start fresh you're kinda short on reasonable alternatives to that spot without making everything more difficult than it needs to be.

Despite this review mostly consisting of complaints there is no way I would not recommend the game. Hundreds of hours of fun to be had even in it's current early access state.",1,942,233.1,June 16

For an early access game, you can get literally thousands of hours of enjoyment from Satisfactory, and each new update will refresh your desire to play and build new and improved factories.

You didn't even get to the power supply; you needed to fix the line feeding this thing into the space elevator, which brought you to the next tier, which allowed you to get the thing you've been just dying to get, plus your sink had enough tickets to get this thing you want, but now you need to feed pricier things into the sink to get the next cool thing, so you had to build a line feeding X thing in...

There is exploration. A whole seperate adventure that you can undertake at your pace.

There is building. Lots of building. Lots of freedom of how to setup your style.

There is fighting. But you can completely eliminate this if you dont want it.

The progression keeps going and feels rewarding.

This is not a high thrills game. This is best played at your own pace. For creative people you can really go out of your way to create ""pretty"" structures. For logical people. You can really be efficient about how you do stuff. I can recommend completing each stage fully before rushing onto the next thing. A solid production line of the early things helps with the later things.",1,706,119.2,June 15

2499,"I love open world sandbox games. Minecraft and redstone circuitry were always my favorite part of the game. Enter Satisfactory, where you can harvest and mine resources to build ever-increasing complexity contraptions! While there isn't a story mode yet, I love the ability to find new ways to build out my base and maximize my efficiency. The modding community around the game is awesome, providing both neat quality of life improvements (like the ability to monitor your factory efficiency and belt capacities, as well as whole new sets of building components to better align with what's being built) as well as functional changes with new components, like lift elevators that you can use to move vertically up and down your building without the need of hyper tubes.

My only complaint thus far about the game is that the map, while huge, is static. Every time you load up a new game, you'll be playing on the same map. The resource nodes are always in the same place, the collectibles are always in the same place, etc. If I could take the open world space exploration of a game like Elite Dangerous, the base building and terrain manipulation capabilities of games like No Man's Sky, and have the resource mining and factory simulation of Satisfactory, I'd never play another game again again.",1,1096,83.1,June 14

2509,"We all know it. We see Early Access and roll our eyes. The grim reminder in our libraries of how we got burned by trusting: ""The game will be finished soon, We promise this and that and all that absolutely soon"".

And then they are the glimpse of hope like Rimworld, or in this case Satisfactory.

Satisfactory, the satisfaction of developers to show others how to handle the brand of Early Access.

There is no nonsense roadmap with ""set in stone"" dates. You don't get meaningless updates every week to get you false hope of progress.
There is on other hand a good communication with community and lot of ways how to give feedback.
This whole thing is handled the satisfactory kind of way, the professional way.

The Good: it look satisfying, sounds satisfying. I have encounter single crash in SP (note on experimental branch), progress/exploration/fun factor, oh you know it = satisfying.

The Bad: MP is unstable, crashes a lot. Some visual issues - tied for me to AntiAliasing with foundations (fixed by turning it off, yet got blinded by sun reflection time to time).
Some small bugs and visual imperfection (tied to EA status) like certain equipment clipping and similar, but for me nothing game breaking and the game runs more smoothly than some AAA full released games (hello Batman).

So watch some LetsPlayes and if you are intrigued by this game, dont hesitate - As a rare gem, this game is worth your money as it was with mine. With a little bit of polish this game could be released and be worth more than it cost now.

Okay, so this game is very addictive, offers such a rich variety of things to do, things to build, things to improve.
I mostly play together with a friend and we rarely run into any issues (trains a bit tricky to handle for the client). However, we ran into some performance issues recently but to be fair, our factory is quite large – I wonder what the total length of our conveyor belts is. The developers are updating this game constantly, so I'm sure they'll find a way to fix the remaining bugs easily :)

You can modify this game with more Mods like new Power-Sources etc!!!!!

You already can spent days,weeks by building your fantastic and good looking Megabase, Train-Stations and so on.
I spent over 30 hours building a good looking Logistic System which is also functioning really well ;)

Absolutely phenomenal mechanics between machines, except for liquids those can be glitchy and difficult at times (or I just don't understand how liquid is actually supposed to work). The biggest headache you'll have is the logistics of getting material where you need it.

Placing down large buildings feels amazing and truly like you are getting more powerful as you progress through the game. It is addicting, and keeps you engaged.

My only complaint is how grindy the super super late game gets. And by that, I specifically mean the Assembly Director System. At this point in the game I'm not motivated enough to manually place down all the parts required to make these in a decent amount of time. I basically just left the game idling at night for a few days. I'd like to see a tweak to that recipe or maybe automated factory construction.

2649,"I want to say that this game is amazing and beautiful, and I plan on sinking many, many more hours into this game. That aside, there are some ideas, some useful and some aesthetic, that I think would make this game even cooler.

- Alarm systems. These can trigger sounds if you reach a certain threshold of power usage, items in a storage container, water reservoir depletion, pre-set time like a stopwatch, or have it constantly sounding the alarm. Bonus points if the alarm has a rotation light animation can be colored at the light control panel.
- Industrial decor. For example, cardboard boxes, crates, stacks of metal sheets, bundles of tubes, and pallet stacks to put these decor items on. This would be great for warehouse themed builds.
- Green decor. Planter beds, etc., for foundations. Trees, shrubs, flowers, etc., for the foliage decor. These can give further crafting uses to leaves, flowers, and wood.
- Computer system that catalogs your production, power usage per buildings (constructors, smelters, etc.) and panels (building blocks that go on walls) that can display whatever information you wish them to display.

Of course the devs can do and will do whatever they want, but I think these things would be cool. Either way, this game is great. Highly recommend.",1,1090,62.0,June 11

2702,"The game is awesome. Addicting, engaging (but not urgent) pace, great levels of abstraction, and a healthy dose of ""figure it out yourself"" lack of instruction later on. Perhaps that last point about the tutorials is because it's in test, but there's something satisfying about figuring out how to be an effective player on your own.

Cons: Really the only cons i have are with the current state, and it seems they've put off on some of the simpler issues to focus on mechanics. Things like:
- buggy af mobs
- haven't really implemented model collisions
- automated pathing buggyness
- plz default the cursor to the text form when selecting a search operation

2719,"So I'm leaving this as a don't recommend as the game needs to make some pretty major strides to be much more than ""grinding in 3D Factorio"". There's basically no challenge unless you do what I did and travel far, lose your starting weapon and then build next to enemies... Then you'll spend an hour being miserable just because you can't defend yourself.

Other than that... I just don't see where the challenge is. There's no real presence to work against. Like in Factorio (which was also too easy in my opinion) at least there's a growing enemy presence that attacks you.

Its a very pretty game, and has loads of potential... But its just not there yet.

I think once we get some sort of real enemy the game will be a lot more fun and something you'll want to play with friends. Right now... Its kinda like playing Forge in Halo alone... Its cool... You can do cool things but there's no challenge.",0,759,3.1,June 9

Keeping things neat is my priority but I'm not too overly fussed about it, you can basically go as crazy as you want to. A lot of room for different playstyles! I got addicted to automating things so that I got time to go out and explore for resources. I just started on trains and oh my god...

You get to use your head, think about problems and solutions, and just have a great time. One of the biggest downsides to his game is the story. I don't really mind it, but if you like games with a lot of story and lore I would not recommend this. Why are you on this planet? Who is FICSIT? Why are you sending resources into the sky to unlock new things? To make him rich? If you really want story to a game don't get this one, but if you just want something that will get you going for hours, totally get this.

2773,"I kept waiting for this game to be fun, but most of it is sitting at a crafting menu with your mouse button held down by your headphones for 30 minutes so that you can get a slightly faster conveyor belt. Everything is tedious to do, until you play the game for a super long time to get everything automated, which at that point the game isn't even a game. It's still just sitting there, waiting for resources to pile up so you can unlock slightly faster conveyor belts, letting you make faster automation for the same purpose. It's just a cycle of boring grinding. The exploration of the world basically consists of standing at your base waiting to unlock a scanner upgrade, using the scanner, making a beeline to the ore that you scanned for, and going back to base after setting up a miner for the ore. I can see how people might be able to have fun with this with friends, but it's so overpriced that you would have a hard time convincing them to essentially get an idle game. I liked astroneer, which is also an automation game, but in astroneer, you're dealing with about 5 resources at a time, tops. In this game, some of the objectives are something like ""get 2500 copper wire"" which takes about 20 minutes to even craft. They're obviously different games, but for the same price one is so much less tedious than the other. There's clearly been lots of planning, time, and care put into all the aspects of the game, but it's just not fun, and it doesn't do enough with its expansive map until far too late in the game.",0,1262,20.6,June 8

2778,"Wonderful visuals and well paced progression make this a very addictive game.

Although I have not finished the lush starter world (still have tier 8 & 9 to complete), I have to admit I'm thoroughly addicted by this promising early access game.

Visually, the game is stunning, and I'm constantly distracted by the unique panoramas the game has to offer. The various machines used to craft everything are interesting enough to keep you from being bored looking at your creations. Perhaps, the only thing I found clumsy was the limited shapes and lack of various textures for the foundation blocks.

As far as game play goes, there is a good mix of building manufacturing plants and transportation systems and the need to go exploring for new resources. However, I did find that it took way too long to get a decent weapon (rifle) but, apparently, you're supposed to be building stuff. I really like the various vehicles and personal enhancements you get as you progress. I can't wait to try the hover pack, and just hover around everywhere.

2805,"Satisfactory is definitely unique, but loses its charm relatively quick. The whole idea of automating resource collection over time is a great idea, but everything else about it kills the vibe. I'm sure they'll make more maps in the future but there's currently only 1 & it doesn't change... All nodes, enemies, etc are in the same locations, ""Multiplayer"" is severely lacking, has many bugs, & with extreme limitations of hosting it's almost impossible to have it run by a dedicated server. Based on gameplay Satisfactory was meant to be more of a singleplayer game since many of the bugs I've seen occur in multiplayer, but at this time I can't see myself playing solo since there's next-to-nothing else to do. There's really no ""exploration"" other than the map itself (no cave systems, etc), & ""survival"" is, well, there may as well be no enemies.

Do I recommend it? Not really. Until more gets implemented it sort of remains broken, & the unchanging map, along with lack of any story, makes multiple playthroughs quite monotonous & boring.

I gave it an honest try... 330 hours just trying different things. I had hoped to find something more than simply building the same stuff over & over... & over. I've since uninstalled it until a later date. I'll renew this review after 2022 when it's slated to leave early access. Perhaps bug fixes with multiplayer, an added storyline, a dedicated server option, implementation of the WIP devices, & more will peak my interest enough to keep me involved.",0,1266,329.9,June 8

2929,"This is really one of those times where I wish Steam allowed something other than a simple yes/no. There's a lot that's really great here, but I can't recommend it in its present state.

I originally had a long essay detailing various frustrating experiences I had playing Satisfactory, but after reading back it just felt like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ about unfinished mechanics in a game that never purported to be anything but early access. Things like tedious and frustrating wheeled exploration in a tractor that handles like an overloaded zamboni. Or the perplexing lack of a noclip console command, when glitching into and getting stuck in terrain happens just about every game session. Or half-baked and poorly signposted game mechanics like getting caught in a ""Live, Die, Repeat"" scenario when I naively picked up some uranium ore and died instantly, then hiked my ass back to my corpse from a klick or so away, hit the ""grab all"" button in the looting UI, and died instantly again because no one outside the wiki bothered to tell me that having uranium ore in your inventory without a hazmat suit kills you in a zeptosecond. I did that maybe six times before I figured out about the ore, and had to basically do a save-scum routine to get all my stuff back.

All that said--and more besides, I assure you--I look forward to seeing where this game goes. The factory building itself is really well done. The act of building itself is very fluid and intuitive, and it's very absorbing setting up production lines and fine tuning both efficiency and use of space. The tech trees are very good at providing incentive to change up what you build and how you move and store things, and even though exploration is frustrating and more than a little chore-like, it IS gratifying to unlock a new resource and set up entire new processes for extraction, refining and manufacturing.

Also, I may be reading more into it than is there, but I think I detect a subtle sort of commentary about consumerism and the environment in the gameplay itself. You mine, transport and expand only so you can make more parts with which to mine, transport and expand. You run around ceaselessly looking for biomass to fuel your reactors, cutting down whole forests and denuding caves of mushrooms. You'll find yourself exterminating local fauna not because they drop precious resources, but because they're a nuisance when you're trying to build power transmission lines or resource-transporting conveyor belts. From what I can see, only certain resources have spawn rates, and for the most part plant and animal life is not among them. So eventually you'll see your factory at the center of a lifeless zone, forever expanding and assimilating everything in its path. It's damned clever if it's intended.

Altogether, I'd definitely say keep your eyes on it, but for now pick it up on a pretty steep sale, or if all the good stuff I mentioned seems worth the substantial frustrations of early access.",0,2482,37.1,June 5

This game is amazing, Just having the freedom to explore and build what you want fills me with so much happiness.

2949,"Factorio in 3D with a bit different mechanics. Some are better, some are worse. That is all what you need to know about this game.
All the advantages of this game are described in other reviews.

I want to point out four main flaws in the game that did spoil the gameplay for me.

1. Lack of challenge.
It has no Biters. Nothing threatens you, nothing to defend from. You just build for the sake of building. In time it becomes boring.
Of course there are hostile wild animals, but they do not possess any real threat. They also do not attack your buildings.
Biters are very essential part of the Factorio (I compare Satisfactory to Factorio because the core game mechanics are the same), which adds flavor to the the game and makes it much more interesting. Satisfactory lacks it, unfortunately.

2. Poor optimization for massive multilevel factories.
In the beginning of the game I had 90-120 fps. When I built my 3 floor factory my FPS dropped to 40-45. And I just climbed to Tier 5 out of 8.

3. UI for building is not really good.
You can't make any little adjustments to already built <anything>. You can't change angle, rotate or move. This is very annoying when you have to rebuild from scratch conveyors or electric poles because you initially incorrectly placed them on few centimeters.
Connecting conveyors in the distance is a pain. You have to point very precisely otherwise it wont connect or it will connect to the wrong direction.
Connecting power lines is also a pain. Until you research MK2 electric poles in pretty late middle game you are stick to poles with 4 connections which is a very frustrating. You have to put poles everywhere. It is so annoying.
No blueprints or tools for mass construction. Building large amounts of assemblies is mundane and repetitive.
And other minor issues that frustrates you.

4. The world around you is vast and beautiful but besides collecting energy slugs in reality you have no reason to explore it. Nothing to do there, nothing to collect there.",0,1686,79.8,June 5

2972,"For people who are wondering if this game is worth buying, it is. This game is an early access, but is still pretty well optimised despite having a ♥♥♥♥ tons of items going through the entire map. If you like games where you progress with objectives and have everything automated, this game is what you are looking for. It doesn t require a ultra good pc setup, but the later you get in the game, if you want to add mods, you will need a decent config as it will lag more and more. The only major problems I have faced are with the train's time table and conveyor elevators (both in multiplayers) cause i was not the host, but honestly, the host can just fix it easily, so yeah. In this update, the problem is the lack of exploration: You do not need to explore at all. You can get everything with just the mam and just going to where the ressource you are looking for, and don't need to look around cause there is no real advantage to that. You can have hard drives, yeah, but not all of them are good, and most likely not necessary. I hate the dev who is in charge of monster spawning and management, i really hate you, you evil bastard. N.B.: I put this review as a bad one cause, if you are like me, you will go through the bad reviews first before buying a game, but i really recommend buying this game if you are into crafting, farming, automated games, and I mostly talk about the cons of the game, so yeah.",0,1160,201.4,June 5

As of the moment, my only real issue is connectivity issues when playing multiplayer, however, it does seem the developers are currently working on remedying those issues and, thus, I'd say that this game is still worth the pick up even despite this one shortcoming.

Definitely try this game out. Lots of content to sink your teeth into. Great relaxation from other high stress games out there right now.",1,862,84.1,June 4
3029,"Impressively addictive. Beautifully crafted world(s) with an amazing amount of creativity put into the flora and fauna. Progression is relaxing, yet engaging enough to keep you playing for as along as you can. And when you are not playing you are strategizing on what to do next, where to explore or how to improve the efficiency of production chain and connectivity.

3188,"I'm starting this review from when satisfactory is in early access, content is subject to change so if what you
see doesn't apply, updates may have changed the game. im going to be writing about satisfactory at different points in my playtime because
i hope that this will help with developers in seeing how a new player feels towards the game, but also the progression and change
of opinions.

13 hours into satisfactory v 0.4.2.6: Satisfactory is the first factory building game I've ever played. The closest comparisons to
Satisfactory i can make are Subnautica and No Mans Sky, both games that i love. If you like either of these games check out satisfactory.
I think Satisfactory is a gem of a game, parts of the gameplay like designing your own systems and picking up leaves are immensely
satisfying. around 6-7 hours into my playthrough i finished the space elevator tier one on the first world and its been really interesting.
The graphics are beautiful, the gameplay is engaging, its especially good when i just wanna idle for 10 minutes and be on my phone while
still progressing because i fueled the generators. the exploration is great because the environment is so visually engaging.

up until now i think i've been mostly spoiler free, but now heres a big SPOILER WARNING VVVVVVVVV everything from this point on will
be without concern for spoilers so beware

So while i love this game so far, i do think that there are some problems. of course there are, its in early access.
Right now, the combat is lackluster. i've fought four types of aliens and it isn't anything particularly special. the charging ones
can catch you by surprise but as long as you circle them you're mostly good. but sometimes, sometimes the charging ones bug out and
double, triple, or quadra tap you because they carried you with their charge. the fireball enemy is interesting, but immensely
challenging to dodge and kill effectively. the spider enemy is just a nuisance and the big charging enemy i was able to cheese by
just hiding behind a mushroom and getting it to come close while staying safe and tapping it. to be fair, ive only had my taser the
whole time and i know i can get better weapons but i just havent done so yet. I also haven't seen any hints at there being mobility
upgrades, and if there isn't any, its gonna be a real heartbreak for me because of how far i have to trek. even if i was able to spend
precious resources to temporarily boost my run speed, id take it.",1,2074,13.8,June 1

Amazing game, especially with friends! I think it took roughly 90 hours to get the the nuclear reactor with almost 3 people constantly on at one time",1,442,255.5,May 31

I can tear down a factory and rebuild it with a completely new design in an afternoon.

I barely play anymore for the same reason, I originally got this to play with friends and unfortunately most of the time multiplayer has had it's bugs so we are STILL patiently waiting for dedicated servers. I can only hope they will release it soon (they said sometime after update 4) because we have been VERY patient waiting for the servers to come out and frankly it's getting to the point where it might be too late. Lots of great games are coming out this year and I would be sad if me and my friends moved on and lost interest in Satisfactory because of the amount of time they took to get servers up.. (even though it's apparently been a priority for half a year.. hmph). Single player is great, multiplayer is fun but the wait has been disappointing and I can only hope they stay true to their game plan to implement dedicated servers before it's far too late for me and my friends.

3342,"This is a bloody brilliant game.

Satisfactory feels like two titles merged into one.
In the first, you'll be creating the factory, which presents a series of growing challenges to your building and organizational skills, as you are tasked to set up complex production lines, made up by increasingly large machines that will require a vast amount of space and complex logistics.
Tech progress is made up of milestones, that you can unlock in the order you prefer (most of the time) by submitting specific products, and which in turn make you able to manufacture complex parts that will be required to unlock the next tier of technology. Such tiers bring about veritable revolutions in how your factory needs to work, and present whole new sets of challenges.

About this first aspect, as an avid player of building games like Fallout 4, Subnautica, Raft and Valheim, i must say Satisfactory may well have the best system i have ever worked with. The way things snap into place while still giving you flexibility and providing cues that facilitate orderly allignment, is near-perfect (yes i think i said pretty much the same thing about Valheim but Satisfactory is even better).
It's also deeply appreciable that can you replace things like conveyor belts with their improved counterparts without having to dismantle them first. You're going to have to built a LOT of conveyor belts.

In the second game, you'll be exploring the untamed wilderness (you start out by foot but can unlock a rather satisfying choice of vehicles and accessories like a jetpack), looking for resources and special items (some of which are still work in progress and not used but hey, can't hurt to stock up in advance) and defending yourself from aggressive fauna as you discover a world that is absolutely beautiful, often breathtakingly so, spanning from grasslands and forests that look like a mix of Pandora and Halo, to desert-like biomes, wetlands, swamps and volcanic valleys. Obtaining the special items will often require you to overcome a combination of challenges like reaching high places, surviving toxic gases, clearing boulders and beating particularly nasty encounters.

The map is truly vast and gave me a sense of wide-eyed exploration akin to that of Subnautica (but without the terror because technically it is you who are the threat to the world this time XD).
And finally, the soundtrack does it's job damn well, switching dynamically as you are either working in the factory or out in the field.

Satisfactory is definitely one of those games that i will keep installed forever, returning to it again and again. If you like building games you MUST have it.",1,2241,190.8,May 30

Imagine Subnautica on steroids when it comes to building and crafting your base/factory. The balance of survival with crafting and the beauty of the open world is on par with every other game of this genra. I HIGHLY recommend playing this game.

Just remember it is early access. The autosave feature protects you quite well from any bugs you experience, when is not really often, but they do happen. Mainly getting stuck.

My only recommendation at this time to the devs, is make it so you don't have to hold the mouse button down while working at the crafting bench. Maybe make it so you have to stand at it, but have an auto-craft option. I've been using my phone as a weight to hold the left mouse key down when trying to pump out 1000 screws.. lol.

3362,"One of the best open world survival-craft games that I have ever played. Your job is to scavange for resources and use those resources to make the parts required in order to unlock more blueprints to make better use of the resources available to you. But what makes this game different from other open world survival-craft games is that you can automate evrything. You can build machines with the blueprints that you unlock and let the machines do all the work for you so you can sit back and relax while draining the planet from its resources more efficiently. But the planet that you were sent to is not that safe. You must fight with some locals that are trying to protect the resources of their planet. Luckily you don't have to build walls or turrets because once you get rid of them they won't respawn and they don't damage buildings anyways because they are dumb. This game offers infinite possibilities with its large world and building mechanics. You can build whatever you want in this game. You can build tiny starter production lines or massive factories but you'll probably give up on trying to make your creations look good and end up building huge pile of spaghetties. You have to find creative ways to move the resources or the parts because resources are scattered all around the world. You can use conveyors, trains or even drones. Getting good at the game and finally building something decent will probably take a long time but once you get the taste of accomplishing something you will realize that it was all worth it.",1,1288,80.2,May 29

The graphics are great, especially up close (highest settings), I wish it was possible to set you view distance (distance at which the game renders grass, bushes etc) without having to type in a command on the console every time I log in

Music/Sound effects:

The music is good but not amazing, I usually just turn on Spotify instead, the sound effects are only useful if your exploring because they can tell you if an enemy is approaching, otherwise they are a bit overwhelming.

Satisfactory’s gameplay is smooth, reliable and fun, everything just makes sense.
Playtime:
•2-4 hours
•10-15
•20-40
•40-60
•never ending ✅
While satisfactory DOES have a progression system, there is still so much to do once finishing it, gathering power slugs, finishing the research trees, getting all the hard drives and just building and optimizing stuff will add unlimited hours onto your world, and if you get bored, try the multiplayer or start a new world or get some mods!

Bugs/glitches:
•bad (everywhere)
•Meh (they’re there)✅(multiplayer)
•good (rare)
•great (almost never)✅(single player)
•perfect (never)

Seeing as satisfactory is in early access, CSS still has a ways to go before the bugs are exterminated. My friend came in my world and was apparently accosted several times with bugs, but I was able to go onto someone else’s world and have no bugs. I very rarely have issues in single player, when I do it’s usually due to conveyor belts or wacky hit boxes.

Pc specs:

Satisfactory IS well optimized, but players with lower end PCs will be turning things down, which always sucks.

30€ for more than 260 hrs and counting? Need I say more? Better than 60€ for Valhalla just to find out I need to fish for 30 hrs just to finish the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game (♥♥♥♥ u Ubisoft).

Final Verdict:
Satisfactory is a beautiful game with an amazing community (the discord is great) of both kidders and players. The Mod tool is super easy, just click the mods you want and restart the game (although some mods can cause crashes and other issues). It has bugs and the Epic-Steam multiplayer is terrible and takes forever to troubleshoot, if your getting it from recommendation of going to recommend it to a friend, make sure they get it on the same platform as you. The graphics are cool and impressive, the music and sound effects are good as well; There’s also a nice photomode that can be used while moving to helpfully allow you to zoom in. No payment required after buying the game and all updates are free, the devs clearly care a TON about the game and are pretty transparent with future updates, doing weekly update videos and engaging with the community.All around amazing game that I’m extremely glad to own.",1,2528,361.4,May 29

3388,"Now you know that Josh made a pretty good representation of the game when he can make a conveyor belt cocoon to pretty much nowhere, be the leading exporter of nuclear waste and have the devs put it in their preview pictures.

So, Satisfactory. A few of my friends would sometimes call this Factorio 3D, but it really isn't. There are many mechanics in this game that differ from Factorio. You have hyper tubes to transport you between many areas, the buildings you need can be instantly built as long as you have the resources for it and conveyor belts can be on top of another conveyor belt. All of this really cool.

Now, if you think the map is procedurally generated, it isn't. When I learned that when I started several saves, I felt like it was a bit of a letdown. Maybe they plan to make ice or different worlds later after the early access game is complete?

The main goal of the game is to dig up resources and reach all of the milestones available in the game, all while delivering things to space with a giant space elevator. All for the sake of filling the ever necessary demands of the consumer.

Things I particularly appreciated are that the game world is beautiful, the game is generous to the player, not punishing, and the construction and tech tree make sense. Of course some suspension of disbelief is required, as when one pushes a button and a nuclear plant grows from a collection of steel beams and other parts.

The game is intellectually challenging as well as presenting challenging amounts of risk. At times I found my attention riveted to the play.

The game world is very detailed and cleverly worked out with a lavish amount of attention paid.
Though the game is classified as being in early access status, it shows a high degree of polish. If you’re interested, you should buy this game while it’s in early access, before the price goes up. I can’t honestly think that much more will be added.",1,769,1747.1,May 29
3404,"Satisfactory is one of those games where you say you'll play for ""Just an hour,"" play for a bit, then look up at the clock and realise you've been playing for 9 hours straight. That's not a bad thing if you keep that in mind before starting a session, because that time pays you back with the satisfaction of watching your well made factory manufacture highly complex parts from raw materials. Or, as with my playthroughs, start with a plan, then vastly underestimate your logistics requirements and watch as your beautiful factory spirals into a maze of conveyor belts and scaffolding. The game requires a lot of thinking and a bit of calculation to get things flowing smoothly, but that's the biggest part of the fun in my opinion.

On another note, the assets and gameplay elements that Coffee Stain adds always feel like they were tested properly and designed nicely well before their public release, which is pretty rare for an Early Access game.

Reward/unlock are spaced so that you can nearly access the next upgrade, just play 5 more minutes etc.

But can you lose? No you can't. Can you embrace a variety of approaches? Absolutely not. Just build, farm, build, farm, connect, connect, connect. It's not a game as much as it is a toy.

It's a reasonably cool toy though. You can chill building what is indeed a satisfying factory. Not a clever one, not a challenging one, but yours truly, and there's joy in that.

3479,"If ever a game was to restore at least some faith in early access games on steam, this is it. It's not an incorrectly called beta, or half assed base abandoned by amateurs, it's a fully working, good looking, smoothly running game, with universal controls, personal touches, humour, and, so far, no bugs that I've come across myself. I can only hope that it isn't another cash grab and the developers actually finish it.",1,365,19.0,May 28

3487,"You can easily forget the world. The game is fun and complex. The downsides : Not everything can be automated (Once in a while, you need to go out and grind for leaves/flowers to craft biomass to use it to power your supply chains), The building placement system can make you mad : The game won't let you place things on where it should be placed (Multiple floor building is very hard - impossible to implement)
I would say It's very promising.",1,382,12.3,May 28
3488,"An amazing game with lots to do. I've played Factorio a lot before I tried this but this game is so incredibly fun, interesting, humorous and good-looking. The optimization is still garbage and your base WILL affect your FPS and create stutters when moving around.

3509,"It is a good game, but if feels like it is not really decided what it wants to be. The factory building thing is amazing, and that alone makes me recommend and enjoy this game. There are few non-game breaking bugs on that regard, and it is interesting to play different styles of factories and progress.
What bothered me is the other things about the game. I understand the main focus is the factory building, but this game tries to introduce a story, which is mostly irrelevant and while it does not adds to the game, it also doesnt subtract from it. This game introduces combat, which is also more or less irrelevant, and does not seem to take it anywhere.
While I think the factory building per se is good, other aspects of the game should be improved once they are introduced.",1,658,13.6,May 27

3515,"This game has a long, LONG way to go.

-The UI is cumbersome due to the 1st person perspective. I get what they were going for, more of a real survival experience compared to Factorio's 3rd person perspective. But it is very time consuming and tedious to place/route conveyors cleanly.

-The 'buildings' just float in the air without the need for any support whatsoever. You can take the time to make it 'look right' but it doesn't actually matter. Places floors, build a factory, delete floors. Magical floating factory of magic. Yay, science.

-The assemblers take inputs on one side and outputs out the other, making assembly lines very bland and lacking in creativity. The robotic inserters of Factorio provide a much wider range of arrangement options between chains of assemblers which allows for a broader range of creativity and problem-solving for the players. These 'In on the left, out on the right' assemblers make building assembly lines a boring grind with little in the way of limiting factors beyond time/effort.

-It lacks a means to copy/paste groups of assemblers already built in tight, efficient layouts, forcing you to make additional copies manually, click by click.

-The tech is laid out poorly, unlocking things that would be very useful in the mid-game only in the late-game when they are no longer of any use to you.

-The late game just keeps scaling up the volume of items needed, but with a lacking mechanic to copy/paste groups of assemblers, it's just a grind to build more copies of each thing one at a time to meet the late-game demands.

-The vehicle transport systems to carry resources between outposts are pointless. Sure the vehicles transport items faster than a belt, but the truck stations only have ONE belt for input or output, so it is still bound by a 1-belt bottleneck. There is no difference between a truck route and simply a very long belt between outposts. This shows the devs are adding features 'because it would be cool' instead of a calculated functional niche it is to fill.

-The map is fixed, non-procedural and has massive holes to oblivion in it. There are waterfalls which rain down on to dry land. There are rivers/streams which are too shallow to be harvested as a water supply and thus completely pointless.

-The day/night cycle adds nothing to the game experience. Nothing is different between these two times. No predators come out at night, etc. Nothing changes. It's just dark, and you turn on your head lamp. The lamps/lighting you can build to combat the darkness in the factory is ... poorly done. Each light consumes ONE MEGAWATT of power. It's easy for the lighting to consume more power than the actual factory. Fortunately, they added a light switch to the game, but still... 1MW light bulbs? Really? Come on. Also these 1MW light bulbs illuminate very small areas, so you need a lot of them. And the game engine obviously has a hard limit on how many light sources it can render because you can see lights that are 'on' but not casting light until you get closer. It just looks bad.


This game has some good working features.

-It hasn't crashed or frozen on me yet.
-The multiplayer runs well with my friends.
-Performance is smooth even when streaming.
-No glaring memory leaks.
-The Hard Drives you can find through exploration allow you to unlock alternative recipes for various components, allowing for a unique combination of recipes, and thus a unique play-through factory design experience, each time you play. That's a really good idea.
-The 'company store' as a means to buy/unlock various equipment upgrades is also a good mechanic, allowing you to unlock just the tools you need/want and providing smaller-scale achievements/goals beyond the longer-term goals of unlocking the next tier.


All-in-all, I do not enjoy this game. The beginning is fun, as the effort versus reward is well balanced. But as the game progresses and resource logistics and demand scale up, but I still have to build everything one click at a time without the ability to copy/paste or blueprint layouts, the effort goes up exponentially while the reward does not. Then it is many hours, or even days, of grind to unlock one more step forward. Not worth it. The game has potential, but in its current state, it is a FAR inferior knock-off of Factorio or FortressCraft. Far inferior.

Don't buy it yet. Make the devs earn the paycheck by actually finishing the game.",0,3712,111.8,May 27

3518,I LOVE IT! I'm vary open minded but not that easy to impress. But this game delivers for sure. The vary moment you spawn in it feels like an adventure. YOUR adventure. You decide how you want to play the game witch makes it your own mission. You just can't stop while your at it. The graphics and the environment is truly amazing and the over all experience (sound/effects/animations/handling/details/physics/amount of gadgets/the feeling when you reached the goal you set) is great! The game is easy and hard at the same time. If you forget things it's all on you. Poor planing will hit you in the face. What's your goal? Efficiency? Mass production? Design? Practical? Why not all in one? The feeling when you use to run... but now you drive B) The feeling when you use to collect leaves and sticks for fuel but now you've made machines that generate all energy for you B) It's rewarding. It's good exercise for your brain... and with some creativity there's no limit to your masterpiece. It's 5/5 from Sandwich and that's rare stuff coming from me. Peace out!,1,894,286.5,May 27

If you're happy to be self-guided, though, it's a wonderful world to explore, and automation is a great solution to the problem of grind in open world games.

Pros:

Beautiful, gigantic, handcrafted map.

3578,"A great game, however a few problems. Lets start with the positives though!

The logistics through the game are pretty easy. They ramp up eventually, but the game makes it easy to ramp up products and get you engaged in trying to make things as ratio'd up as possible. Brilliant tools to use, such as zip line (which I know is a new addition), blade runners, re-bar gun and a host of other things really makes you think about what you need to carry and use to do each part of the job well.

The game is only around 40% logistics though, to begin with. The map is beautiful, and very atmospheric. Danger feels like it is around the corner all the time, but then you also feel free to jump and explore all the time. So much vegetation is abundant in each area making it feel alive.

Multiplayer is fun. Go off, explore each going their own way, with their own projects, all to make the final product faster and more rich. A dedicated explorer and a dedicated builder ensures a massive collection radius of resources, locating ore points and scouting for new building areas, whilst the builder ensures the explorer has a home to come back to.

The 3D aspects of building, although looking daunting from the outset, is actually made very easy and simple with a huge range for building objects. The models and textures for the game are also very rich, and brings the factory to life.

With all this positivity I have to start with some bad parts. There is only one map, and this on its own is not bad. It is a great map, very large, lots to explore. Hand crafted. But this is where it falls down. If it was procedurally generated I could happily give a pass, but its hand crafted.
So why, oh why, do we have floating grass? We have elongated textures in some harder to reach but still easily accessible places where the cliff face should be cliff, but its clear its an elongated grass structure. We have hidden power slugs still underneath terrain. Two resource nodes too close to each other to use both at the same time (that I've come across, possibly more!). This is a hand crafted map. It should receive more love over the 2 years then it has.

Also where are the extra maps? 2 years, no extra maps? Or teasing for extra maps? Or DLC maps? Nothing? I'm happy to give them a pass on this one, under the guise that they want to make sure that everything else in the game is polished before they add more maps so that everything on a new map can be balanced. But I've had the game for less then 100 hours and I feel like I've seen everything on this map now... I feel ready for a change.

AI mapping and attack sequences still appear to be missing in some areas. One enemy type literally just 'floats' about, no animations what-so-ever. I'd be happy to say it was just me, but I've seen it on a friends machine too. 2 years to add some animations to an enemy? Because this enemy has been in the game since launch too. AI tends to stick to zones which is fine, pretty standard in most games... But I've also seen the enemy run directly away from me outside of their supposed zone to... ???

The prices of the logistics ramp up very quickly. It can go from needing a couple of iron spots to needing at least 20 to keep the later mechanics going at a pace. Spent a long time just setting up the expansion of industry which is pretty much copy-paste other areas I've already built. Doesn't sound too bad, apart from there is no copy-paste function or blueprint function that I've found in game. Quite happy to say we can only copy stuff on foundations etc etc or any limitations, but if you have a factory game Factorio set the standard, and that standard now includes copy-paste...
In the past I'd have happily spammed the left click for foundations, but now that should be base game to easily expand areas rather then rely on mods to fill these spots. This goes for a lot of the little problems with building, ""Oh there is a mod for that"" should not be a go-to response.

Models are... Boring? They all do the same thing, again and again and again. For the smelters this is okay, we are smelting ore. Ore goes in, ingots come out. There is no animation. But you've provided one on most of the other machines, and these animations should respect the recipes set. The production of a rotor should get a different animation over reinforced plate, and so on and again. This will really cement the idea that your factory is alive and allow you to see from a glance what the machine is actually doing.
The last issue I have with models is clipping. You don't allow clipping through other models but terrain is fine? Wires dangling through foundations? There is little consistency here that needs tightening up, don't allow clipping through terrain (either by just don't let us or add extra supports) or allow us to clip through everything.

This leads onto trains. Now spamming signals everywhere seems like a bad idea in this game, however you could program the rails to add them in dynamically or something. But to have no clipping trains? They feel very cheaty.
This then leads onto a lack of a logic system. Okay this is a stretch of a lead, but if a train isn't full of a product I would rather it didn't leave a station. And this starts to lead onto a lot of the other industries. I can't store only a little bit of product, its a full cargo container or nothing. Automated power systems are not a thing, I.E. Power is dipping under a certain point, please stop supplying the grid until you've recovered your own personal area of power. Okay, we can separate grids and I would honestly suggest to any players to place their coal miners and water extractors on a separate grid, but can we not logic that? Well no, because that system isn't in the game...

And lastly multiplayer. I already know they have said they are still working on the code. But when you load into a world and I can not see what products are on a belt it makes me feel like the factory has died, and took me a while to realise that the items were just not visually loading in for me.

It is a good game. But I would love to see just a little more effort on what is in the game at the moment over adding more mechanics for mechanics sake.",1,5083,194.9,May 26

3582,"As of this writing it's still a little rough around the edges, but if you want a beautiful, humorous, somewhat less complex and less combat/defense oriented take on Factorio or Minecraft tech mods, this is it.

To be clear it's plenty complex enough, and if you've done something like Technic mod pack in Minecraft it'll feel very familiar, down to many of the basic game mechanics, technology tiers, and resources. It's just not quite as deep as Factorio, which is not necessarily a bad thing! Satisfactory is more approachable and lower pressure overall, while still leaving plenty of room to obsessively optimize and build ridiculously massive factories.

If you're looking for combat, look elsewhere. At the moment it seems tacked on and shallow. Monsters do not attack (and cannot damage) your base, and mostly serve as occasional annoyances while you're trying to build your rural infrastructure or as trivial obstacles to resources. Fighting them is clunky - you're hilariously ill-equipped for it, but on the other hand their AI is basic AF so once you figure out their patterns it's easy enough to deal with them. If it weren't for the fact that they drop a few items you need in small quantities, I'd rather they didn't exist.",1,1049,81.1,May 26

3599,"Satisfactory vs Factorio

The chances are that if you've found yourself looking at Satisfactory, you also know about Factorio. Being a Factorio player, I was intrigued by Satisfactory because as good as the former is, you soon find yourself wanting to do things like build multi-level conveyor systems, which leads onto thoughts of a 3D automation game.

So here we are, 3D Factorio right? Well, no. Satisfactory is a bit of a slow starter; the initial premise is the same - you've arrived on an alien world with little more than a toolbelt and a bit of knowledge. You're going to need to collect raw resources with your bare hands, and assemble them into something useful. At this point, Factorio isn't fully committed to trying to kill you - whereas Satisfactory will start to try and do that pretty much straight away (depending where on the map you go). Fortunately you have a handy stick and once you understand how they work, the initial enemies are reasonably straightforward to dispatch. It's worth mentioning here that where Factorio provides you a random world, Satisfactory's is very much hand crafted - it might lower replayability in the long run, but it looks great and offers some early challenge moving around (and remembering where you came from).

Shortly after finding your feet, you'll be directed to, or will have managed to build an iron miner, a smelter, and a belt between the two. This is much the same in both games, automation at last! Obviously not forgetting that you need to hook machines up to power poles, and your early power stations - biomass burners, need feeding with leaves and wood collected by hand.

This is where the games start to diverge again; in that now, you're quite comfortable with the enemies you're fighting in Satisfactory and you've largely worked out that they protect certain areas, and don't come and attack you or your factory. In the other game, you might have started having to repel your first waves of the bitey things which will keep coming and keep destroying your stuff.

It's at this point where Factorio ramps up the complexity; lots of machines required to build lots of components, to go into machines and ever refine into more specialist components - Satisfactory follows the same path but more gently, the production chains aren't that long or complex - at first it will be a simple transformation of one part to another (ore->ingots) and then onto machines than can combine two, then three, and four comes near the end of the research tree. It's not trying to kill you constantly (to the point where you can leave the game running and know you're safe), and so you can enjoy it as a rather relaxing (and very pretty) factory building game. There's always stuff to do, but much of it is making things look nice, tweaking them for efficiency, refueling your power set up, and leveling up by sending your components back through the space elevator you've by now built. You'll enjoy building factories on top of factories if you so want, whether you have a single large building or lots of little focussed installations at various places is up to you. Your ore miners never 'run out' in Satisfactory, so whether things work or they don't, are currently powered or not, makes little difference as long as you can go and get the things out of them that you need.

I like my games complex a lot of the time (never needlessly so) and hence made the comparison between what is on paper, two very similar games. What I have found though, is that whilst I will go back to Factorio and try to further that game - I've really enjoyed a quite, well, satisfying experience with this game.

I think I'm near the end of Satisfactory; and I think it's near the end of it's development cycle. What remains to be seen is whether it's replayable in its current state (and whether I'd want to), or what the developers add in the finished game to make you want to go through it all again and again.

That said, in one playthrough I have more than had my money's worth and so heartily recommend this to anyone.

TL;DR:
- Satisfactory is 3D and allows you to build upwards and outwards and enhance your spaghetti mess like never before. It looks lovely and runs well.
- Satisfactory tries to kill you early on; but overall is far less threatening than Factorio which will kill you and destroy your factory.
- If you die in Satisfactory, you respawn and go to loot your stuff. In Factorio, you die and have to reload a save or start again.
- In satisfactory, your automation setup feels less complex than Factorio. There's precious little filtering (but some) and lines that effectively handle multiple products (you can split and merge but 'smart splitting' is fairly advanced in an optional research tree). And there's plenty of room not to cram everything into a small space anyway.
- Factorio has lots of logic stuff going on and really programmable machines, I have seen no evidence of that in Satisfactory. It's not a bad thing, just different. This is less hardcore.
- The two games are different enough that if you like the genre, you might like both and it's worth owning both. They may compete in the same space but they also compliment each other, with sufficient differences in how they play out.",1,4365,90.5,May 26

But then OCD hits and forces you to dismantle them and place them in a row with all conveyor belts turning at 90 degree angles and you need lights to show off how good of an architect you truly are and then create majestic, massive coal power plants. WHY?!? Because that's the only way it looks correct....That's why. And why is it when I hear that power outage sound it hurts so much it makes my ears bleed?!?

And to everyone that uses the arachnophobia option...You are the reason why I'm now terrified of kittens!!!

It was super-addictive for the first 12 hours that I played in a single stretch. I finally went to bed after building my first coal power plant. After that it gets a bit more difficult.

Having finally begun refining oil and having a rifle, blade runners and jetpack certainly helps.

I got this game because I loved Tropico 4 and was disappointed in 5 and, even more so, 6. I wanted to be able to manage factories. While this game is completely different, it's still amazing.

The graphics alone are incredibly great, especially considering how well it runs on my laptop (as long as I have an external fan plugged in).

Pros:
- If you were thinking about getting divorced this game will probably make it happen
- i am like 100 hours in and pretty sure i am just scratching the surface
- world is beautiful
- this type of game from a first person perspective is something i never thought would work but it does
- world feels totally immersive
- The world is huge... or at least seems huge.

Cons
- building verticaly (which is encouraged) can sometimes be frustrating because there are a lack of affordances lining things up. Trying to install a vertical conveyor from the ground that needs to go up 3 or 4 levels can take several tries.
- because of what I mention above it sometimes the game is fighting you to build things. Things not lining up, things not being copied in the same direction or with the same recipe and small annoyances like that sometimes rage me. But i realize its early access
- it will consume massive amounts of your free time. Seriously, you will say I am going to sit and play for an hour and you look at the clock and its 4am.

I dismissed these views as the deranged ravings of rabid fans, the like of which you only find lurking on fanatical subreddits.

I don't know when they started. The voices, I mean. Now when I get into bed I hear them all competing: ""what're we going to do with the heavy residual oil?"" ""We should expand the coal power plant, the current output isn't fit for purpose."" ""The belt capacity alone won't support more factories!"" ""When are we going to connect the secondary sites with transport tubes?"" ""With a throughput of 200 screws a minute we'll barely be achieving an output of 8 rotors!""

Now I go to sleep thinking about it. I think about the next project; I think about laying the foundations; I think about the splits required; I think about the input quantities and byproduct mitigation. I think about the areas I still need to explore; the beacons I need to collect; the components my factory hasn't automated yet.

And, after the thoughts stop, I dream about it. I dream of the resources moving along the conveyors. I dream of the recipes and the options. I dream of the travel tubes I'm going to put down. I honestly wish this hadn't happened, but it has.

But how can I not dream about it? When you look back at your factories, no matter how messy or spaghetti-reliant, they still look marvellous. You'll walk amongst the chimney spires belching smoke, ride the conveyors with the inputs, gaze at the increasingly intricate production lines. After the dust has settled and the uranium rods come rolling out for the first time, you won't be able to help but think ""I am a god and all will marvel at my work.""

3669,"Here's the thing about Satisfactory, what passes for combat and enemy AI is anything but. There's always a group of enemies guarding every node (at least the five or so that I found in the admittedly tiny amount of time I could put up with this game) you have only a taser with a nonexistent range to fight them with (I was standing in front of one of these enemies who couldn't enter the room portion of the tier 3 HUB and couldn't hit them but they could hit me, it was directly in front of me and I had to basically walk into the character model in order to land a hit) so you die basically every time one of these things aggros on you.

They also chase you ENDLESSLY, you have to die to get them to stop at which point they return to their original spawn point, which is on top of a resource node, effectively making that node useless unless you want to dig up as much as you can before you die then try and retrieve it from your corpse and run out of the aggro range before the enemy kills you again. The combat and enemy AI which is basically just endlessly chasing and attacking anything that enters aggro range, is completely unbearable and makes the fun stuff impossible to enjoy, purchase refunded. Maybe I'll try again if I ever hear that they fixed this. No I'm not interested in a peaceful mode, I'm interested in enemies that I can actually fight off or at least run away from.

It's surprisingly fun and on the quest to fully automating you'll easily fill your time, I personally am at tier 8 but uranium takes so much effort I'm putting power pylons across the entire map, basically I'm no-lifeing at this point but it's ok because it's such a fun game with amazing graphics.

3699,"-I have always enjoyed these types of games. Making larger and larger factories to create more and more products to sell in order to get stuff that allows you to create larger factories. But as fleshed out as this seems and as good as it looks, I'll be looking for another game. There is only one reason for that... the power system.
-I got all the way up to coal power which helps A LOT. The system before then is so horrible. It required me to constantly micromanage my generators by deforesting everything the eye can see, then crafting the leaves and wood into biofuel and running around, filling generators every 30 minutes.
-With that said coal still has it's problems, no matter how hard I try there is no good way to organize cables or coal generators. It is always a mess.
-It's hard to put into words why I dislike the system so much. All I can say is I spent about an hour organizing a new setup and I was excited to see how well it worked. But then I was stuck messing with the power for another 2 hours.

I wish there was a way to turn off the power requirement system entirely in a world.
There are other similar games that just give you the satisfaction of organizing a factory without this system .

Or here is another fix. Allow me to connect coal generators to 1 pole allowing for everything connected to that pole to be 150 max watts instead of 75. But allow it to work with infinite amount of generators.",0,1181,12.5,May 23

There's also exploration, the map is hand made and quite nice. There are also things hidden across the map to find that will help boost your factory's productivity (power slugs, crash sites).

3829,"Solid functionality while in Early Access. The base game runs well in Single Player. Multiplayer still a little glitchy.

On Launch, I'll be waiting for:

Fully fleshed out story / environment: Coffee Stain has used lots of placeholder things that have promise.

Replayability: Once you've made a factory that does ""all the things,"" it's hard to imagine why you'd load the game back up. The game needs some valid reason for zeroing out the research and buildings to start all the way back at Square One, or a reason to keep engaging with a complete factory.

Right now, I can recommend this Early Access title. Even if there was that thing with E.G.

We'll have to see after launch if that changes.",1,600,141.1,May 20

3847,"What can I say that hasn't been said about this game already...

You know, I'll say this, then. The game is fantastic. It really does steal your time. What I enjoy most, is that once you set your factory up perfectly, you can simply let it do it's thing, while you go out and explore the map. Since the 4 starting areas are just points to begin on the grander scale of the big map (32km^2), wherever you start, you'll be able to access the entirety of the map. So you can explore, gather up hard drives from crashed pods, or power slugs to overclock your machines.

And the machines really are the heart and soul of the game. They are so well animated, and the rush of getting everything to line up perfectly with 100% efficiency is one I never expected to love.

Clock speeds of machines is something that seems simple at first, but you realize that you can also manipulate power requirements of machines using it, to keep your power grid from getting overwhelmed.

Overall, I did not expect to love this game as much as I did. I bought it on Epic Games Store before it came to Steam, and bought it again once it hit Steam, since this was the only real reason I used Epic Games anyways. Definitely worth buying.",1,1009,97.0,May 20

Coffee Stain did a great job with this game. Even in Early Access, my experiences have been smooth, non-buggy hours of fun. With 95 total hours played, I need to bump my numbers up, but I am really enjoying the various aspects of this game.

I really like the in-game store concept that is implemented. By having a conveyor belt system discard your waste, you earn tickets and you can redeem them for additional cosmetic pieces, vice paying real $$$ for the cosmetics. You will need those pieces, because the world is massive and you can pretty much build anywhere, and your factories can be as large and spread out, or as condensed as you want them to be.

3898,"So the beginning of the game is pretty straight forward

Process item A to turn it into item B

Then eventually Combine item X and item Y and Get Z

However to do this on a sufficient scale you have to create factories, multiple buildings processing items in parallel.

The problem is that in the second half of the game things have to be processed in a crazy number of stages in varying proportions, that is not taking into account alternate recipe’s that, while simplifying the process, alter the proportions required. The game needs specifically on the higher tiers to make it easier to plan these long chains of stages to get to your desired items. You can try tools like or to try and plan out the factory, but there is no guarantee these tools are up-to-date.

As of Update 4

It’s enjoyable to a significant extent, there is a lot of potential and it seems they are rounding their late game setup, but if you are going to make it this in depth at the end you need something to help you plan.",1,838,388.7,May 19

The progression route is a little strange, utilising materials and optimisation to unlock the next tier of items. But that's also what I love about the game. Its a chill material grind game whereby you create machines to do the hard work. Then the tougher steps involve more materials which require more machines.

(@) Early-Access, Update 4, 250+ hours playing at this point

(@) Overall:
Started just before Update 4 - with the drones and power revamp. If you loved Factorio, Love the old Minecraft Factory mods, you should enjoy this game as well. Still in early access, some quality of life improvements still need to be made.. Has some combat threats that can be handled with either pure physical responses or even planned ranged death. The belt connecting system is good, the transport system has many options to play with. Vehicles can be used to transport or explore the world.

(@) Pro:
The game has a good vibe for exploration and a wide expanse of a world. Plenty of places to go and see, different biomes to review and explore. I like to build with my friends, co-op is one of my big attractions.

(@) Cons:
Not being able to line your factory up very easily in the beginning. Some multiplayer bugs at this time cause strange things to happen, like out-of sync errors. I am hoping a quality of life update will fix these. No dedicated server option - that I know of, this would be great to run in the background.",1,1029,340.6,May 17
3974,"TLDR: Missing mid-game quality of life features, thus forcing players to slowly do the same thing over and over again.

The first 20 hours are amazing. Having played hundreds of hours of Factorio in the few years leading up to Satisfactory's release, I had this one on my wishlist for a while as a possible 3D Factorio alternative. Now that I've played it, I can say this is way more than a mere 3D Factorio. This is an entirely different game and new experience. Added bonus: this game has stellar detail, graphics, and animations

I love how Satisfactory encourages the steady buildup of a factory. The tech tier unlocks usually transition you smoothly to an ever expanding factory in which you can go back to upgrade miners, double production, use faster belts, add more constructor machines, and expand into the distance for even more resources. It is also easy to get a perfect balance between miners and machines, and upgrading throughput is a simple matter of upgrading and/or overclocking a miner, then using the new raw ore to do whatever you need. This game provides a steady growth and expansion without ever feeling overwhelming. The game walks you through each new unlock by forcing you to build it before you can unlock the next tier. You can't simply research everything and then find yourself overwhelmed and unable to build. I never ran into a ""what do I do next"" confusion.

Instead, what I did run into was a mid-game terribly lacking every quality of life feature to make it worth playing. As I increased my ability to harvest resources, I also needed to increase the number of machines processing those resources. This involved an incessant rebuilding of the same layout over and over and over and over without end. Also missing is the ability to duplicate vehicle automation to have two or more vehicles perform the same function.

I don't see myself ever finishing the game unless this monotony is removed by fixing:
- Lack of blueprints drives repeatedly building the same setup over and over and over.
- Lack of map to show what obstacles may be in your way to get to that node that is 1800m away.
- Forced to spread far and wide to find all resources, but lack of fast travel options to quickly get around to your different outposts.
- Not everything can snap in place, making alignment sometimes difficult.",0,1954,45.0,May 17

The title is an already apt description for the entire experience. After spending actual brain power figuring out how an efficient assembly is supposed to run, and then translating it into an aesthetically pleasing monolith of a factory, the levels of pure satisfaction you're able to achieve are only limited by your imagination and the raw resources given to you.

4059,"This game is literally the exact opposite of the ""satisfaction"" I get from an actual game like Factorio. For a game that relies on 3 dimensions, you would think of the multiple more layers of accessibility in both features and form in comparison to a simplistic 2d factory game like factorio. But alas, it does not.

I've played this game for a total of 100 minutes, and every minute was a seething mess of emotions. The fact that a game with an extra dimension doesn't have something as simplistic as an alignment tool for god sake. Everything you do ends up being an unaligned mess for no reason what so ever. The devs took the time to add an alignment tool to BUILDINGS but nothing else. Why on earth is there a limitation for a basic principle of functionality.

The game has awful collision, so I'm assuming they didn't play test the few first starter items you get to play with at the beginning of the game, considering this was a half arsed mess on release that barely featured anything. The first thing I attempted to do was to jump on top of the player base, only to fall through said base just... because? It's literally THE first item you build and half of it doesn't have collision. Nor does any of the random crashed ships, and nor does have the conveyor belts, as the first thing I did was accidentally place an electric pole through a conveyor belt. And of course, you can just place down electric poles as you please without any consideration of buildings, with the same kind of connection system as Factorio but without the ease of use features such as ""Hold down the mouse and drag to automatically place the damn things down"". Instead, you have to manually place the pole along the long ass line of conveyor belts you just placed, go back to where you started, and connect each pole INDIVIDUALLY. After 5 years of development your first thought to one of the BASIC features of your game wasn't to make a simple drag system?

The game is a pretty blatant rip off of factorio, even things as simple as crafting speeds and amounts of items you get from crafting things. It's the same basic functionality but even more jank because good luck looking for something as simple as an ore vein, because they are literally impossible to find and you WILL end up spending 20 minutes looking around for them. What the hell are you thinking to not include a simple piece of equipment you can build to help you find ore veins at the beginning of the game, surely if you're to copy something like a game such as Factorio you would consider... I don't know, the extra dimension? Especially when it's a selling point for god sake.

I have no idea why the crafting bench OR the armour bench exist other than to fulfil the purpose of what your inventory crafting should do in most other games, but the difference is that for some reason you can spawn these massive buildings out of the blue, but not a portable miner. Portable is IN the name, I get it's an item, but the fact you have to actively keep messing around going back to these massive work benches for the same thing your inventory can fulfil, then why have the extra step inwhich the massive factory you have generate and sprawl out isn't treated the same way, when I can just use a regular miner. It's annoying and isn't intuitive. Don't make the workstation an entity you can just literally click on, make separate tables and enforce a reason to actively have these different stations, other than just having two for two different arbitrary reasons.

Scrap the factorio comparisons. Minecraft Feed the Beast is a mod pack made by generally anyone who feels like making a mod, on a engine running on Java of all things, in their own time, not IN a studio and developed by ACTUAL game developers. And I will be far enjoy and love playing that more than I enjoy playing this, simply because it isn't a clone, it isn't jank and lazy game design. And, most importantly, it doesn't have the most rail-road factory building systems that rely on the most bog standard tier systems known to man.

The conclusion of my experience is this; this is a lazy, half arsed rip off of a clearly superior game, maybe not in overall features, but DEFINITELY in play-ability and ease of playing the damn game. 100 minutes and the only thing I've learned that this is a over-remembered mess of a game that constantly trips over itself because the devs don't check their own spelling mistakes in their exam. It's a joke. Go back to the basic elements of your game and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ fix them, because it's an awful first time experience that feels slow, unimaginative and clunky to play.

4096,"Even though there are some features that haven't been fleshed out yet, the game is incredibly fun! A few times I ran into the issue of a large order seeming tedious (i.e. it's going to take forever whether you automate it or do it manually), but given that the game is in early access I think that's forgivable. My hope for future updates is that there will be more to do out in the world while waiting for things at the factory to finish",1,373,59.6,May 15
4097,I haven't played the game in a while and don't know much about the new update but I can say this game is amazing. I currently have 80 almost 90 hours on this game and have enjoyed every second of playing it. Even if you start to get bored you can download the mod launcher for the game which has tons of really helpful mods and some even make the game feel completely new. Overall i think this game is worth buying and you can just refund the game if you don't like it.,1,394,87.8,May 15
4098,"I thought this was going to be a game only about optimizing your factory in an essentially sandbox environment. What I got was a rich game with a very well designed alien world to explore, with subtle messages about environmentalism and the beauty of nature contrasting with the efficiency of machinery. There are literally breathtaking vistas, vast beautiful cave networks, impossible alien landforms, and completely on point music and sound direction. The slightly sinister feeling nature of your FICSIT overlords lends some deep nuance; what are you actually doing here? What role are you playing, and who are you serving?

I'm not an optimizer. I enjoy efficiency, but I'm not one to overdesign to get there, so my bases end up having a naturalistic ""base camp"" feel, while my friends are building towering factories with rows and rows of machinery. I'm really glad to say, this game supports both playstyles fantastically. I see my friends having a blast designing and organizing monolithic black cubes full of layers and layers of machinery, whereas I love spreading out and nestling my machines in with the trees and cliffs.

The one thing I would dock this game for is that the ecosystem feels too player-focused. I want to see predators chasing prey and fighting other predators for territory. I want to see animals that consume resources, and possibly animals that caretake and develop their own resources as well. This might not be the game for that, and if you're also wanting to see an alien ecosystem spring to life, I highly recommend Subnautica. However, I can't deny the intentional design I feel in segments of this game. Collecting power slugs to me feels like collecting Missile Packs in Metroid. They are usually placed in areas that have a similar challenge feel to them, and are a wonderful reward for exploration. I can't wait to find out what Somersloops and Mercer Spheres are for, because they provide such an intense incentive to explore that I think is missing from some games like this.

There are still bugs and glitches, particularly with enemy AI. It's very rudimentary and when you master kiting enemies, they don't provide that much of a challenge, even with the Xeno-zapper. It's only when they congregate and team up against you that they feel like a challenge. On the other hand, that complexity is used to great effect in the placement of hostile mobs today, so I can't knock the simplistic AI too much because it combines and scales difficulty fairly well, despite the somewhat limited toolkit for designing these encounters.

Also, placing the Space Elevator is a religious experience. I don't care how jaded you are, it's a masterstroke of technology that that sequence plays out so organically and dynamically. You really *feel* the scale of the structure, and it changes the skyline forever.

I feel like there are still some quality of life hiccups around inventory management. As an FPS player, I often find myself hitting the number row to switch my in-hand equipment, only to remember too late that those hotkeys are for your building toolbelt. I'd love a way to switch between modes, even if it just means holding shift while pressing a number gets the build mode quickbar, and just pressing the number equips a new item to your hand slot. On the other hand, there are some very nice Quality of Life touches that I appreciate once I've gotten used to the quirks of this game. Actually placing buildings is decently streamlined, and I appreciate the way building off of foundations allows for a very granular angling. Once you're started building a foundation to fit the area, the 90-degrees snap-to-grid functionality feels very useful. The only complaint I have here is the sometimes janky feeling of trying to get conveyors to snap together. It can be very finicky about what counts as a valid angle, and the feedback isn't always clear about why a conveyor can't be constructed. ""Encroaching others' area"" ends up being a somewhat frustrating exercise of shimmying things around in minute ways just fiddling to get the lines all connected.

Honestly, though, the game is beautiful enough to warrant the price tag. I don't just mean graphics specifications and technical aptitude. The design of the game's assets and their placement creates spellbinding beauty. The way biomes flow into each other feels extremely organic and immersive, and I've never seen transitions so smooth in any other game. It feels like it surpasses Breath of the Wild in this respect, and some of this may be because setting this on an alien world helps smooth over any strangeness in geology or botany that would subtly break immersion otherwise. There are so many systems in this game to become familiar with, and the tech tree feels so rewarding and rich that it compels me to develop more and more. All in all, this is genius design. Mad respect.",1,4079,58.9,May 15

4237,sorry i cannot recommend this game it has many flaws and with out mods is a very plain game that turns into just a repetition of building the same stuff and with zero support for win 7 players with no dx12 support with this game i have to give thumbs down windows 10 has the worst driver support out and i lose my blueray drive and soundcard support if i try to upgrade to ten i have tried so with no win7 support and having to rely on mods to build is a big sorry thumbs down and with the limited amount of fixes for the amount of bugs even in early access is not good and there is just so much unfinished stuff in the game needs alot more work sorry guys but you killed it for me with no support for win 7 players,0,588,2034.1,May 13

4239,A great and very addictive game! My only complaints are the available weapons selections are very limited and there is no transport available to you for some time.

From zipping around in hyper-tubes, to maximising efficiency in your production line, there is always something new to do for your factory. The scenery is absolutely fantastic with some of the most aesthetically pleasing biomes the gaming world has ever seen.

4266,"I don't quite know what it is that draws me in so much, but I thoroughly enjoy this game. I suppose the name of the game speaks for itself and truly is ""Satisfactory"" :) My only issue is with the rocks that are 4-5 ft tall since it lets me build foundations through it and the grass showing after building on it as well. Just seems weird to walk into my factory and see a random rock and a bunch of grass tickling my machines :P",1,361,42.1,May 13
4267,"If you have even remotely played Factorio, then you will LOVE this game!

Same vein of factory building on an alien planet, but vastly different on their goals and ""story"" (if you can call it that). The pure wonder I experienced when first seeing the planet upon planet drop was stunning and the game play flow got me hooked!

Everything is so well designed and intuitive that it just keeps you going hour after hour just like Factorio! One of my favorite parts about this is its vastly dense amount of biomes filled with the richest colors and designs, so much so that I can EASILY spend way too much time exploring in a vehicle or on foot all the nature there is, on such a HUGE map too!

On the factory side of things, machines are easily designed so that they can be tiled and laid out however you wish, and the shear complexity of it all is astounding! Of course, the further you get, the more complex it gets and you will always need to makes tweaks to your base, sometimes tearing it all down and rebuilding!

TL;DR
Great gameplay, stunning visuals, lots to see and explore, COUNTLESS hours of tasty conveyor spaghetti! HIGHLY recommend for fans of the genre!",1,978,330.3,May 13
4268,"Played 300+ hours in EA Update 3... Now in EA Update 4 and lovin' it! There's an excellent community mod capability & repo that really adds to the game, even though I play mostly vanilla right now (use 1 mod thats a QoL thing, nothing more, no ""cheats"" and games doesn't break when removed [no extra assets]), mainly to get that ""as mom intended"" effect :-) It's a great mix of puzzle and RPG fun! If you like factory building games, you'll LOVE this one!! There's even a bit of shooting/hunting baddies in this one. Only played alittle coop multiplater (its NOT PvP) and if your impatient. perahps try it with a friend to speed progression.",1,544,338.9,May 12

Good game.,1,288,43.1,May 12
4298,"I recommend this game, but I think it is only meant for a certain audience of people.

If you lack patience to learn from failure, can't do basic math for sh*t, or just don't like slow paced games, this probably isn't for you.

If you do enjoy these types of game just know it has a fairly large learning curve IMO, and you'll probably end up absolutely hating your first factory.

What I am saying sounds like I shouldn't be recommending it, but yet here I am. The game is extremely fun, satisfying, addicting, and relaxing despite all of it's flaws. Definitely a game to play if you want something that isn't completely mindless.",1,539,274.1,May 12

4335,"SO, so many crashes. Once you hit end game its extremely boring and tedious. The most fun was killing the stingers (Spiders) but even the AI is really dumb. The fact you need mods to make the game remotely fun is dumb also.
Hazmat suit that you cant use in gas clouds.
Vehicles that shield you from radiation but not gas clouds.
No way to speed up the game like factorio.
You can breath underwater but not in gas clouds.
Trains take so long to unlock and once you hit cap on local nodes the rest are so far away and railway laying takes a long time.
Drones are expensive and you need at least two per node sometimes 3 to get full efficiency from it.
The ticket sink is frustrating and slow as is stacks and gets harder to get tickets.
Weak weapons that take a while to kill bigger enemies forcing you to fill your inventory.
A bigger inventory is gated behind tiers.
The vehicles chew through fuel. ""You are going only 1km to a couple of km's. Yet chews through lots of containers of fuel. SO glad my car doesn't do that or I never go anywhere
Power trips out a lot and can be extremely hard to get running again.
Overall. The game gets boring. It starts feeling like a chore trying to get stuff setup to the point where you stop caring about OCD because you've spent hours trying to get the factory running. Back and forth always getting resources. So many different materials are needed once you hit late tiers is extremely annoying. Most alternate recipes are useless or more expensive. Nodes are capped to belt speed even though you can overclock the miners to be faster, poor game design. The game suffers from extremely bad asset loading lag and is very unoptimised compared to other games using the same game engine. The trains, omg, no signals, clipping through each other, and no conditions like wait times or capacity setting.
Fluid pipes are so buggy and a ridiculous design.
Did I mention crashes? Don't turn off auto save like I did to record stuff for youtube then forget to put it back on. I lost a few hours of gameplay from game crashes and forgetting to save.

I can't go on grinding this game any longer. It's just so boring.",0,1782,641.0,May 12

4367,It's a great game and has many fun things to automate and do. I would really like it if they added a creative mode meaning that we will no longer need creative mode through the use of mods. The game is also really fun on it's own having many hostile creatures and weapons to stop you from uh - dying. Make sure to carry some sort of healing item on you so you can survive to automate another day. Even if your conveyor belts go EVERYWHERE in a spaghetti mess then your factory will still go on even until bauxite and oil. Nothing can stop you.,1,456,247.7,May 11
4368,"Satisfactory is a beautiful hand crafted game for fans of industrial simulation games like Factorio, Dyson Sphere Program, etc..
Other than just crafting, there is also exploration and combat. Beautiful biomes to discover.",1,209,359.9,May 11
4369,"A beautiful factory building experience that scales up at a digestible and rewarding pace. The game begins with you using a pickaxe to mine ore and by the end of ten hours, you are automating and optimizing that process well more than 100x over. In order to accomplish your objectives, this scenario of 'scaling up' ensues at a seemingly sigmoidal growth rate (only if you're up to the task of setting up the necessary infrastructure.)

The exploration expands over treacherous territory- sudden pitfalls, steep cliff sides that rise up hundreds of meters, monsters that defend sought after upgrades, and resources that are great distances apart from one another. The objective is to create a network of factories that utilize the extraction and production from those resources in the most efficient way possible. If that sounds more like work than like gaming to you, then you might be right, because there is no shortage of online-manual-labor required to set up your brilliantly designed automated networks.

But don't be scared away- there is a peaceful aura to the scenery, a pleasing-to-the-ears synthwave-esque soundtrack. The mechanics are polished; the player has the mobility of a fast-paced FPS- able to sprint, jump, slide, fly, and drive, and wields no shortage of tools to play with. Moments of adversity are obscured by the serenity gleaned from looking out over your creations from far away and acknowledging the imprint your technology has made on the landscape.

In the overall process of completing the game, there are milestones to overcome represented by the newest and most difficult products to manufacture, which truthfully challenge your ability to manage your resources and time.

Totally worth the $30 USD to enjoy the game and support an awesome development team.
Highly recommend playing with a friend.

4378,"Completely recommend for anyone who enjoys factory-builder style games. Has potential to be a lot more, but there is already a decent modding scene for this game of which some are multiplayer friendly. By far one of the best early-access games.

Ran a faction-style server for a while (Players were only allowed so many nodes within X distance of their base) to try an economy style of map, worked out great & is where most of my hours went.

Really needs dedicated servers & more reliable online code. Had many instances of game crashes / people lagging despite an overkill host machine. But still early access & I'm sure they've said that's due soon(tm)",1,562,205.3,May 11

4390,"Satisfactory for me is a game which is enjoyable to play. Due to two reasons:
Firstly, there is a gigantic world to explore. So far I have been in caves, valleys, desert, plains, lake, and swamp. As an example, the graphic of the coral texture area has the most detail.
Secondly, the highly realistic and highly customizable building construction makes the player so satisfy to experience. Like the belts.
Since this game we play is Beta version (not finished game). I strongly suggest the game to add more varieties on minerals. Perhaps each mineral will only have only have a few recipes, this can allow the game to have more variables and interesting for experience to play. Moreover, adding some creature that produce bio martial is also recommended. This can add farming gameplay in the game which I think will be popular and interesting to play.",1,727,64.6,May 11

4428,"At this time, I can't recommend the game. Without a lot of mods, it's just another nondescript factory building game. There is no end goal to aim for, just having things automated and optimised to prevent bottlenecks is the only aim the game has. The animals that attack you have a very basic AI which is far too easy to predict and counter and you only need to obtain the next weapon up to become practically invincible, you don't even need the rifle.

Sorry, but at this stage in time, it needs a LOT of work to make it worth playing in my view.",0,463,246.4,May 10
4429,"Overall Score 4/5
Satisfactory feels significant in the space it takes. I have thoroughly enjoyed my time playing and the blend between survival and factory building is executed amazingly.

Performance 3/5
At times when there are a lot of objects or buildings on screen, lag can start to creep in and cause stuttering. This doesn't happen too often and techniques such as hiding conveyor belts behind walls so that they aren't visible can help to alleviate the issue. However, during an autosave, the lag is noticeable and annoying no matter where you are on the map. Besides these issues, I manage to maintain high frames consistently with no issue and have yet to see my CPU or GPU throttle.


The gameplay feels smooth and so far I have come across a few fun glitches. I will say, that for an early access title, Satisfactory feels a lot more polished than others in recent memory. This game is what I wish Space Engineers played like, the graphics are clean and the building feels intuitive. When I have researched a new tier or construct a newly unlocked building for the first time, it truly feels like an accomplishment. The sense of satisfaction from automating a process that was once laborious is incredible and provides a real drive to play. The lack of a story aspect is bolstered by a growing world with a unique design and clear-cut goals that reward you with useful and significant upgrades.


The community that has been built around Satisfactory is accepting and altogether fun to be in. Players on forums and gathering places such as r/Satisfactory are kind and engaging. Sometimes it feels like it might take an architectural or engineering degree to sort out how to make the shiny new item you are after, but taking a step back and referring to the well-made guides and help from devoted players you will make it along fine. This attitude is reflected in a group of Devs that are committed to their craft and truly listen to their players. Their updates are always well anticipated and bring exciting features that add new horizons to the game for your creativity to explore.",1,1756,33.6,May 10
4430,"Build stuff, in order to build stuff, that unlocks new tech that lets you build stuff.

Exploration is always amazing. Huge focus on movement and verticality. Jet packs, vehicles, jump pads, hyper tubes, trains, etc. Exploration is so good it rivals minecraft despite having a single map (albeit large).

This isn't factorio. It's less technical, easier to get into, more colourful. AND. The vertical elements bring a whole new feel to bases. Being able to ship things upwards, or create 3D factory cubes really let's your creativity for efficient design.. SHINE.

4477,"THIS GAME IS AMAZING!!!!!! I don't know if it's just me, but for the last few years I feel there has been a real lack of imagination when it comes to game making. There has been some very big name game releases that I have looked forward to, and yet once they get released and you play for a few days or so, you've played through it all and these developers now-a-days TOTALLY FORGET ABOUT THE GAMES. They make their big chunk of money on the release and never go in and update content or add new things. These big companies release these huge games with so much potential, but they're only out for a dollar. Even if/when they release updates.. they want you to pay stupid amounts of money for them, and if you don't then you are left with a very vanilla game.

This game however, is constantly coming out with releases and new updates... I have put in close to 200 hours and I am still learning something new everyday, and there's soooooo much more to unlock! I've put that 200 hours in and that's just the first game I started with! There are more maps!!! I think you could truly spend a lifetime playing this game and still have things to do and learn.. and it's still in the early release stage!!!!!

I haven't been addicted to a game like this in years.. it brings back memories of the old COD Modern Warfare and Battlefield 3 days when ALL responsibilities went to the side because I couldn't put enough hours in! First time in a long time I have rushed home to play a game.. it actually gives me something to look forward to!! Even at work I am sitting there thinking of ways to improve my systems and what I'll do next!!!!!

GET THIS GAME, BUT BE WARNED YOU WILL NEVER WANT TO STOP!!!!

Big shout out to the mods and developers who continue to put time into this game and have finally sparked my gaming passion again! I would buy this game 10x over again, and not even for the new content.. but out of the principal that you can tell these guys want to make us happy and ensure we continue to love the game!

No real plot or story or progression regarding why I need to spend hours making factories? What's the payoff? I know it's supposed to be satisfying to see a well run and organized operation but...eh.

4523,"If you are someone who needs to learn the concept of efficiency and if you are describing yourself as a perfectionist, you should play this game, NOW!

Whenever you realize the details that is thought by developer, you respect more.

I played 20 hours in 2 days. I can't stop thinking of it. Game design is perfect. Even if you are doing the same thing over and over, it doesn't make you feel bored since it makes the processes more efficient. Developers definitely assimilate the satisfaction feeling in game design and they present the feeling to player as it should be.

The last thing, if you are someone who wants to be engineer, especially system engineer or industrial engineer, you can get general understanding of how things work in a factory. You may encounter the problems that are experienced in real factory such as bottleneck.

4565,"At the time of writing this, the game has a ""Overwhemingly Positive"" rating. I feel this is overly generous. So to balance it out I will vote to not ""recommend"". Steam, please change your voting system.

Like other and very few negative reviews have pointed out, and I feel this is a bit unfair, but we live in the real world where a different game and probably the inspiration for this game exists, by the name of Factorio. Factorio is a game that better captures the essence of what Satisfactory is trying to accomplish.

What do I mean by this? Well, you need to place down buildings and transport stuff between them using conveyors, right? So this translates into a space management problem and playing this game in first person is a fatal flaw. It's very difficult to judge space in first person. This is why in real life we use things like plans on a piece of paper, which allows us to allocate space easily. It's like the idea started a gimmick: What if we could see our Factorio factory in first person, wouldn't that be cool? And then they made the game that way, missing the entire point. It's a step backwards down in game mechanics. If they add a top down view via a drone and a out of the box grid system, it would help greatly.

I found the game to be much simpler than Factorio, but way more tedious. Especially with manually having to collect fuel leaves to power your installation. You can't even hold it down. You have to hit your use key on every single flower. And you need THOUSANDS of them. My finger actually started to hurt. That can't be good for my hands...

It's not a bad game. It's better than average. It's probably even good. But it's definitely not ""overwhemingly"" so. It's not overwhemingly anything.

You can see yourself grow in this game, not just through the progression of the tier system but also through your own logic and problem solving skills. Each production line you set up will be better and you eventually see the pitfalls of your original implementation. You then can choose to refactor the setup completely or make slight adjustments to improve efficiency.

It is an amazing brain exercise. I can't remember the last time a game made me pull out a piece of paper to calculate and design something to be done in game.

4614,"It's okay.

It's not as refined as factorio and there seems to be a prevailing belief that the player wants to redesign their factories about 8 times before the end of the game.

Belting, splitting and merging could be handled better because certain resources like screws get used A LOT and the belts can't keep up in a single line and multi line are a pain in the ass to implement compared to factorio.

I'm not sold on the alternate recipes being ""discovered"" on hard drives. I feel like you should be able to research them or buy them from the sink shop to help reduce the randomness.

Game is still Early access. Single player is okay, but multi-player, it's noticeable. Lots of texture glitches with belts, rendered water that will kill you if you jump into it and areas you can fall through the map, make you not want to explore because you can lose everything in your inventory.

But of course you have to because of the Hard drive and power slug system.

So thinking about playing another game then makes me think of all the things I need to do in the game. I actually have a task list written down on what I want to accomplish. That usually goes to hell when I get into the game and get distracted by something else I wanted to do. This game really focuses on efficiency of the machines you chain together but I'm definitely not running at 100% efficiency ;).

So the building aspect of this game is good but I'm not that good with design and mostly just stick with square and rectangle shaped buildings. The features of the game that I love the most is product automation and logistics. Regarding the latter, trains was a big game changer for me. This has allowed me to consolidate all the items I have in different parts of the world and I'm working on my first mega base too.

4647,"As of update four, this is the most fun game I've ever played. Exceeding my expectations. There are some annoying things about the game. How the environment is not yet destructible. That is my soul complaint. I expected it to be, considering it is a building game. I feel as if it was almost designed into the game, yet removed for now. I can play this for a very long time without realizing 9 hours went by. I usually do. This game makes me wish for improvements. To the Adventure aspects. As of right now. There are only 3 types of gathering objects that improve base(all with the same skin but different color.) There are only 3 enemy classes. Those that shoot you, those that attack you, and those that HOLY OMG WHAT IS IT (BURN IT WITH FIRE.)
And while that is fun. I would like to see further variation on enemies. As well as cute little animals you could befriend. There is only one of those.
I'd also like to see and expanse into the areas you might enjoy. So if you build until endgame (which I have NOT currently reached.) I'd like to see more opportunity/purpose/reason for building (missions, milestones, and rewards.) My current insensitive for building is OMG this is so cool. But I can imagine a game, exactly like this, that gives me incentive(in the form of more content,) as I mentioned.

So to recap. Game is a solid 9/10 or 10/10 game, even in its current version. But
You need varied enemies. Not just what it has now. (Water enemies are an idea, as well as a weapon to fight those, however those may get annoying too. So probably bad idea, just brainstorming here.)
You need more of a research tree that is harder, but gives a better reward. (It just sort of takes 3 seconds for to Finnish almost half of it and progression feels cheap. Its called ""The MAM"" but its a research tree.)
You need to give more options for varried buildings and building types. Its not ""barebones"" however, i'd love to see this game grow with a direction of say ""creative mode."" Or, ""creative lobbies."" As well as more buildable items to meet those modes head on. I believe more stuff to build would expand the world into the realm of WOW THIS IS EPIC instead of just OMG This is cool.

There are probably a million ways to improve the game, but I understand the game they gave me. I love the game they gave me. But even if you play, 24 hours or less, you'll realize, this game is AWESOME
Even if you don't have some suggestions, like me, on what they could improve, even if your critical of gameplay, even if you're thinking, should I buy this? The fun of this game, comes from playing this game. Exploring this game, and building in this game. An area you never knew, eventually becomes a base, or a part of your base.

4648,"I enjoyed some of my time in Satisfactory, but I never got past tier 4 industry because I felt gated behind... building a factory. I enjoy the progression and the exploration, but I don't actually enjoy the factory-building portion of the game. The size of the machines and my closeness to them makes placement and arrangement difficult and tedious for me. I think the game would be greatly improved by a build mode in which is more like a city-builder top-down view. Of course I've heard that there's some kind of hover building thing later, but I haven't gotten to it. Maybe if that was moved to earlier in the progression I could enjoy the factory building.

Moreover there seems to be no overarching reason for progression and factory building other than for their own sake. There's no goal, no real threats (i.e. the bug attackers in Factorio), no point to doing anything other than the enjoyment of doing it.

Great game with incredible art design and performance. But personally I found it difficult to really enjoy.",1,867,106.7,May 7

Once you get the swing of the mechanics and start unlocking more buildings, tech, and cool gadgets, the game takes a thrilling spin and becomes a huge management sim of the coolest type.

At first you are just running around exploring what can be done. Then you begin to realize the largest limitation is your own preconceived restrictions. There is no box... don't try to think within one.

Yes, floors can float with nothing supporting them. Floors are the key to building vertically because they allow you to build above structures without being blocked.

Automation is the key. Then you find that the amount of resources required for more advanced items will change all your ratios of items you thought you needed to build earlier.

I am no engineer, nor am I particularly mechanically minded. The closest I've gotten is putting a chain back on a pedal bike. But by god do I love this game. Everything about it is so immersive and intriguing. Would highly recommend! Also, I really want someone to play with. This game has multiplayer and I am quietly confident I have discovered most of what the single player has to offer (minus a few of the research things) so I really want to build a factory with someone else!

Also, the amount of updates coming out of here are amazing!! And there is still so much to look forward to. Like the alien artefacts, for instance. Can't wait to find out what they are for.
Also the alien shrimp dog bunny pet thing. I'd love an update with just stuff for that little guy, like a kennel for example, and maybe a bow tie.

4730,"The way the tiers work in this game is absurd. They have extremely high requirements, like an old facebook or mobile game, so it sucks up a ridiculous amount of time. You end up running around with a chainsaw to collect biofuel to use to power the generators, and its boring and monotonous.

You don't know what you need, until you need it. You need coal power, so you don't have to babysit the generators, however there's no map until later game. Jesus christ. I just spent an hour wandering through the game, not being able to pathfind properly, only to give up on the coal power, because I arrived at a node that wasn't close enough to water, because I didn't have Copper sheet rolls (or whatever they're called). Tried to find the other node and it was to difficult to get to, no map again. Finally give up and head back to main base, barely 50 rotors were constructed, need 200 for whatever upgrade.

Seriously, why are there no solar panels? Needed to consult a map online to find anything, which was irritating. This seems to cater to engineers.",1,882,63.6,May 5

This game was way longer and way more in depth than I expected. Ive only now began to make progress to get stage 4 and there are 5 in total. I thought it would get repetetive after a while but somehow keeps you entertained all the way through. The only problem is that you have to explore way more than I'd hope for. I keep running out of overclocks that make your factory work at up to 250% speed. Its really well optimised and even if you have a GIANT factory with over 1000 things being moved at the same time you will not lag. Multiplayer is getting way more stable and me and my friend have only experianced minor problems.

Open world, survival base building, tech tree researching, resource balancing satisfaction.

You start on an alien world, dig up resources, arrange electricity, automate resources (smelting, making rods etc) then go from there, increasing your tech tree from making screws to nuclear fuel control rods.

4777,"I don't usually write reviews, but this game deserves it: everything about it is just perfect! There are so many aspects of it to keep you fully engaged: resource hunting, creating new production lines and improving old ones and unlocking new materials and recipes through the tiers, space elevator and research.

This game is masterfully crafted, there is never a moment of boredom because there is always something new to do: improving the power grid because you put down new machines that build new components, meaning you need to tweak your old production line to make it more efficient and maybe hunt down some resource nodes to upgrade your raw material input.

The progression is also very well engineered: you start from zero, having to do everything manually until you can automate the process and then, as you unlock more things, the production lines get more and more complex, requiring some clever thinking and planning to make it as efficient as possible.

There is also a multiplayer aspect, so you can build your factories with friends, even though I personally don't care for that.

While the world is quite large and pretty to look at, the combat and exploration is a bit shallow, however the real meat of this game is in planning and constructing the most efficient mega factories that you can dream up. The building systems seem simple at first but as you unlock more elements to build with the possibilities open up quite a bit, throw in vehicles and all sorts of character equipment like parachutes and jetpacks for some added fun and it's a nearly perfect mix.

About 35+ hours in after purchasing it this week, I can say that it's a blast. There is plenty of room to expand your base and explore. It scratches the base building and problem solving itch. The only complaint I have is that your resources are not finite, so you don't need to worry about resource management.

4829,"I would recommend this game because for me personally I like automation and stuff related to it. The game as well lets you do a lot of things so that you don't bored easily. I also like how the game gives you the freedom of exploring the whole world without limitations except world barrier but that's not an issue for me rn because the world is too big and I only played this game for 106hrs so there's still a lot to explore. Another one is that the game lets your build factories almost endless as well building complex factories which is also fun if your trying to build a efficient and organize factory. Lastly the best part of the game is that they have amazing animations as well models for the machines/player equipment's which is cool to watch and to look at. For me personally I would say the difficulty of this game is average because the game is not too easy and not hard. But of course it will depend on your experience if your a newbie or an expert. The environment of the world is also amazing because it doesn't feel too blocky but instead it feels alive and not lonely. Sound Tracks of the game is once again amazing. Stuff I would like to see in the future updates which I think will be amazing.
1. More Vehicles for all transportation types
2. More creatures and an increase of alien spawn groups.
3. Player elevators/Vehicle Elevators - Useful if your trying to have your vehicles somewhere high up.
4. Refined mod but instead its in the base game
5. Maybe small villages/trading stations with NPCs",1,1263,135.4,May 4

4838,This game is pre-release and it runs better and has more features than pretty much all AAA titles coming out these days. Definitely give it a shot and support these guys!,1,158,137.1,May 3
4839,"Worst $30 I have ever spent. Bought the game to play with friends and while they seem to enjoy it, I have only found a wellspring of misery in my time with the game thus far. I will give the game that the base building is generally pretty good when you are in a cooperative terrain setting but the need to trouble shoot your power supply and the resource optimization process makes this game require a Rain Man mentality that I just don't have. Everything else on the other hand...

First off, I don't think this game benefits from any way, shape, or form from being a survival game. Combat is horrendous, and makes Minecraft's look like a mechanically in depth masterpiece in comparison. Usual best policy is just to avoid it all together, but sometimes exploration forces your hand and you have to engage with this unsatisfying system. Hits feel weightless and the weapons themselves feel like parodies. Exploration itself is also deeply frustrating, with poison clouds and difficult to navigate obstacles constantly barring your path. It takes hours of work to unlock equipment to assist with the tedious expansion process and the vast majority of these tools are just useless. Vehicles struggle to navigate the terrain and provide nothing more than a few seconds of amusement from seeing the cybertruck fly through the air on the launch pad.

I really wanted to like this game, but my experiences of constant frustration with glitches and death have prevented me from finding anything more than a few fleeting moments of pleasure.",0,1294,13.9,May 3

4843,"this game is so addictive. the primary loop is fairly simple to learn and provides lots of enjoyable problem solving. i feel like i figure out a system for doing stuff... then figure out a better one for each major project i worked on. and once you get a factory setup and you're waiting for it to finish building the parts you need for the next unlock there's lots of exploration to do.

i also felt like my exploration game progressed as a series of distinct phases. and i learned different methods based on the available game mechanics. from running around on the ground... to using the truck to go explore new areas... and then using the foundations to make paths above the dangers on the ground. to using power lines and the hover pack to get to wherever i want with minimal issues from the hostiles.

the game also has some really nice quality of life features for these sorts of crafting chain setups. like giving you the items per minute values for the inputs and outputs of the building.",1,836,533.2,May 3

You can play the game in fewer hours and perhaps complete the milestones but the joy is in the building and the balancing of resources.

Mines never run out of resources and the wildlife never destroys your buildings, so when a production flow is established, then it can run forever.
Which is great, as you will establish a lot of production flows, ... and in good and bad that is what this game is. :-)
There is not much of a challenge or puzzle as there are plenty of resources and space. So you play this game to enjoy building huge production lines step by step in a very beautiful world.

4988,"As of 20210501, I can not recommend this game to those that like this genre (Automation, exploration).

TLDR

The game has a great deal of potential to be good fun. However, the design decision to not have any sort of challenging combat mechanics, or some sort of challenging aspect that could actually cause you to lose, produces a game that is extremely superficial, mediocre, and boring.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The odds of you dying in this game are very remote (I still haven't died). The graphics are subpar for a 3D game. Sounds and Music are mediocre at best. The game mechanics are superficial and very simple. Attempting to build vertically is incredibly unrealistic in that structures do not require any support. You can have a floating base if you like.

There is no macro progression in the game either. No blueprinting. Nothing I hate more than having to repeatedly build the same design over and over.

I suggest looking elsewhere, such as Factorio, Oxygen not Included, or even Space Engineers if you really want 3D. At least those games will create some form of challenge are are by far more mechanically intricate and interesting.

90 hours in and I really can't find the fun in this game. Perhaps they will rectify this by the time they leave early access. I will check back once they do, but from what I gather so far I doubt this will happen.",0,1253,90.3,May 1

One small issue. What the hell is up with the Epic Games and Steam integration? I spent way too long staring at the options and just chose to do Steam-only. Solution to this problem would be to have your own account system just like Factorio has.

Currently gone through 2/3 games exploring different starting locations - different methods of building and the game leaves it entirely up to the played on how to manage their Factory.

Overall the gameplay is fantastic - I hope to see future PVE or monster interactions in the future, but even as it stands right now - it is an absolute pleasure which will allow you to explore and satiate all of your OCD needs.

5148,"Unfortunately I can't recommend the game as I've bought it to play it in coop and the multiplayer is just a garbage. The graphics, optimization and game mechanics are in a good shape so singleplayer is fine. But you don't want to play such a game alone.",0,225,13.4,April 29
5149,"At the time of posting (4.29.21) the game is a bit rough around the edges but thoroughly enjoyable. It is best described as a beautiful blend of the factory building of Factorio, the survival aspect of Minecraft, and the open-world exploration of Horizon Zero-Dawn. The graphics are great, and the overall atmosphere is akin to a walk through a dream.

There are a few things still that need improvement, namely how entities can clip through the environment (especially belts and powerlines), and that several items that currently exist in the game but serve no purpose. Judging by the rates of updates to the game I would expect both of these to be addressed before it is considered 'Completed'.

5170,"Was definitely a bit surprised how much this game actually has to offer. Potentially one of if not the most well made factory-based automation game I've played. An immersive atmosphere on an alien planet, similar to that of No Man's Sky, but more lively. The ability to start from absolutely nothing and grow and maintain an efficient (or spaghetti mess) factory is beyond rewarding.

Though what makes this game special to me, is the ability to pause what you're doing, look up, and see a realistically scaled factory that you spent the last 10 hours or more working on. Everything animated and alive, everything towering over you with countless conveyor belts moving resources that were all placed for a reason. The game is actually beautiful, and runs incredibly well for how nice it looks. And that's just the visual aspect.

What blows my mind about this game is how in-depth it is. Not only in content, but with how much planning and math is involved to achieve what you want to do. There is a steep learning curve here, and the skill cap is practically limitless. I've spent so much time outside of the game just planning and thinking in my head or even on a notepad on how to improve my factory, how to do something more efficiently while still making it look nice. This however can be incredibly overwhelming and stressful, but playing efficiently is a preference. The game will always keep you with stuff to do, stuff to work on, stuff to plan out, and will keep your brain thinking nonstop. In my opinion this is the ultimate game of logistics.

My only complaints in the current version of the game are lack of a creative mode (place anything and plan anything with everything unlocked), and lack of reason for combat to actually exist in the game other than a research tree and filler content to do when expanding / exploring. The game has great potential to add onto combat and give it an actual purpose. Powerful items, boss enemies, using assemblers / manufacturers to craft an item to defeat a strong enemy are just a few of my own ideas. Right now combat just feels like a pointless extra, and more annoying than rewarding or fun.

Tldr; game is brilliant, beautiful, well made, fun, addictive, satisfying, and worth every penny. This is a great game if you want to keep your brain active, pass the time, enjoy basebuilding, and / or enjoy automation / logistics. It just has a steep learning curve but it's well worth the time and the progression is well made for learning how to play. This game is satisfactory.",1,2107,280.0,April 29

Yes, it's pretty much Factorio in first person, but that changes the dynamic in a HUGE way, and it's not as much you vs. the environment like it is in Factorio, it's you versus your need to fix everything to be perfect.

This is one of those games that you can play for hours and hours. At first, the game might feel overwhelming, but don't quit or give up. You learn things as you go, once you find a good spot and place your first drill and start building is when it gets addicting. You can get so creative with the way you build and configure your factories, conveyors, power machines etc. This is a great game to chill and spend hours on, and of course it is satisfying seeing your factories and machines come alive. I definitely recommend this game.",1,481,20.4,April 27
5256,"Very fun game when it comes to actually planning and creating factory lines and resource management.

The combat system is an absolute joke however. There are no real weapons and the best weapon available is a stick that you can swing at enemies twice before a 2 second cool down. There is no strategy to it at all and often times you will die to more powerful enemies over and over because there is no good way to beat them.

I have found myself spending hours spending resources to get gear to try to recover my body, only to die over and over again. The game deletes your items if you leave your session so basically if you get tired of trying to recover your body and want to quit, you lose everything.

I am giving this game a thumbs up because it is enjoyable to play when you are actually able to actually plan out a factory. The combat system is just an annoyance and it does not need to be there.

5262,"This game is really very good, and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys puzzles, automation/factory building, and aesthetic crafting.

The factory building element is very rewarding, there is no blueprint function so everything has to be placed by hand. Some may call this tedious, but the way in which all the parts interact is important and can be done well and badly depending on how you choose to approach it. The game also includes a number of stylistic and quality of life type objects that you can unlock to enhance how things look/work.

Researching new technologies and parts is approached in 3 ways: recycling excess materials, crafting new complex parts to unlock milestones, and map exploration to find alternate recipes and new resources. The map exploration element really makes this game exciting and interesting, as you are forced to search further afield for new exotic resources to feed into your factory.

The recent update adds a proper ""end game"" with a stupendously complex set of recipes to craft in order to finish the game. The scaling of the technologies in general is very well done, and you always feel like the next step is challenging yet obtainable. Each milestone you unlock gives access to new parts, which normally require new recipes and layouts to add to the factory.

Multiplayer works but has some de-sync issues occasionally. The devs are very open about the fact that multiplayer is a Work in Progress, but it's still playable and really fun with friends. The solo game is also super gratifying, as everything you achieve is your own doing, and your friends can't mess up your perfectly tuned assembly line.

If you're still unsure, you'll get a good feel for the game in the first 2 hours as there isn't a lengthy scripted tutorial, so try it out and refund it if you don't like it.",1,1538,187.6,April 27

Caveat:
This game is in early access and has some issues. Personally, the most annoying of these is the frequent stuttering, which happens even on my pretty sweet PC. I have looked into this and I believe the devs mentioned that the issue stems from the way the world is streamed.

With all of that being said, I really do recommend this game. It's everything younger ever wanted from those OLD old Roblox tycoon games and minecraft redstone, and its easy as hell to sink 100+ hours in.

5348,"A great time-waster. As the title suggests, incredibly satisfactory. I havent played many other factory management/creation games, like Factorio, but I have played somewhat similar games like Dyson Sphere Sim., and Mindustry. Satisfactory, from what i've heard about Factorio, is a 3D version of it with more emphasis on large base building then exploration or survival. You start off at tier one, and work your way up by upgrading or completing tasks in The Hub to unlock new categories, blocks, extra inventory space, etc, and use the Space Elevator to unlock the next duo of tiers (3+4, 5+6, 7+8, etc) by sending Project Parts into it. To summarize- a crap ton of time required and a crap ton of glorious automation. I highly reccomend if you like any factory management/creation sim. Is good.
Also, the Lizard Doggo. Nothing else I need to say on that.",1,731,247.5,April 26
5349,"Satisfactory is - and I keep forgetting this - in Early Access. I forget this because it is not plagued with glaring empty spaces or problems like many Early Access titles are.

Satisfactory is a sandbox production / management sim in a nutshell. It can be played alone or in multiplayer online. The multiplayer though is the most obvious sign of the Early Access state of the game. Vanishing objects and UI bugs plague the multiplayer. However, it is still a good time.

When experienced in solo, Satisfactory feel remarkably polished. The visuals are nice though obviously not AAA. The movement for the player feels good. It is smooth, simple and even quite entertaining. You can slide jump (Sprint - crouch - jump - release crouch) much like in Apex Legends for quite a nice speed boost. While I'm sure this wasn't intended, it is JUST easy enough to get a taste of but just tight enough on the timing to be a good minigame to play with yourself as you move about. I am constantly slide jumping lol.

Satisfactory has a solid tutorial opening for the player (skippable but I advise playing it) and doesn't hang itself up much on having a reason to exist. They introduce you to your employer and just leave it at that, giving them some lore to make a few fun jokes with but not much else. This is nice because it doesn't get in the way but at least it exists.

The gameplay is... well, it is good. You connect machines to belts to resource nodes to other machines... and the whole thing is a giant puzzle, art project and checklist all at once. I love playing this game while chatting in discord with friends even if we all play solo. Great stuff, highly recommend.",1,1388,124.1,April 26

5372,"Have you ever played a game that takes you by surprise at how good it is?

Satisfactory did that to me.

I started it in lieu of the adventures i could have on a foreign world, facing exotic wildlife and building weapons to fight them. Soon, I realised I had stopped worrying about those critters, and was more interested in whether or not my floor blocks lined up perfectly. ""How can I place blocks in two different areas and line those squarely?""
Then came the period of micro factories. Then came the power cuts from over exuberant assemblers....
""Rather let me start again, now that I've learnt better methods.""
Rinse, repeat, get next level of tech. ""I better start again, so i can incorporate these parts into the process next time...""
and so on.

In short.

The graphics are surprisingly good, especially player movement from a 3rd person perspective.
The atmosphere is strange, weird and engaging...what one would expect when exploring an alien world.
and most importantly, The game play is fantastic and there are many many hours waiting for you with replayability only limited by your imagination.

From the start, the tutorial and the phases of building slowly stack on the complexities while at the same time, rarely feeling unbalanced or leaving you questioning ""Okay, now what?"", the world is kinda small in some ways, however there's several biomes to explore all with different threats and benefits. Now, when I say the world is small, it isn't necessarily a bad thing as fast transportation options are limited so reaching one side of the map to the other feels like an accomplishment.

5448,"Satisfactory. For my time playing it, i have been loving it. I love the atmosphere, the mystery behind the alien landscapes, making and building your own working factory.
-
The game is all about creating a working factory on an alien life formed planet.
To get your materials you are harvesting from the natural environment, smelting the resource, and then crafting them by hand. Gathering the right quantity needed for building your working machines, making your factory, bigger, resourceful, and orderly. Making such a big factory though- is also like puzzle solving, figuring out the technical sides of it, making it all work, as well as finding the right placements for each machine so it can all work in harmony with each other.
Then-
On the other side of things.
There is the open world around you. You are surrounded by a strange, unusual alien planet. With weird plant life, creepy hostile creatures, where you either have the choice of running for your life, or fighting your way through (For more alien life formed resources...) or cute little neutral creatures, that are either shy of you, or just out right not interested. The environment is dangerous, mysterious, and keeps you asking for more, and exploring more, while your factory is working back at home.

In short - This game has a variety of everything, it is entertaining, and laborious, with a hint of combat, mystery, and excitement.",1,1194,15.0,April 25

5483,"The benchmark in factory building games

Satisfactory is an extremely fun highly rewarding game. From the beginning, being dropped onto a hostile planet with nothing but a prerecorded computer voice to guide you, the size and detail of the world will immediately draw you in. The amount of immersion the developers created is something to be cherished and is lost in a lot of games these days.

The object of Satisfactory is to explore the world, discover resources to mine, research technology to create the biggest and most optimized factory that you can. The game will give you a loose set of goals to reach in a step by step way and set you free to basically do what you want. The amount of freedom you are given to explore and build as you want is one of Satisfactory's strongest selling points.

The game is still in early access but it doesn't feel like it all. There is a mountain of content that has already been added to the game and the developers are constantly adding more as the months go by. There are some great and very detailed YouTube guides that can can watch to get you started if you feel like getting a bit of help. The feeling of adding a new wing to your factory, researching a new technology or shooting a ton of materials up a gigantic space elevator leaves you with a satisfying feeling worthy of the name of this game.

Satisfactory is definitely worth the price, actually it is an absolute steal if you like this genre of game. What will you get for your money? Hours and hours of fun whether you are planning on playing this solo or with some friends as well as a 'Ill just finish this last section and then go to bed' kind of feeling. I highly recommend giving this game a try you will not be disappointed!",1,1441,28.5,April 24

5488,I love the game but i also don't like how you can't have infinite resources to make whatever you want i wish that there was a builder mode that allowed all resources just be there for the player with not having to mine or get materials so that you can a machine do it.,1,233,5.3,April 24
5489,"Pro's:
- Has quite a lot of buildings.
- Has quite a lot of options on where to build.
- Good graphics.
- Has good potential.

Cons':
- Cannot alter terrain.
- Lack of endemic life (and variety).
- Cannot bind tools (such as weapon, chainsaw, beacons) to hotkeys.
- Placing big buildings feels clunky on low ground due to FPS view.

Although the game is great with diversity in buildings there is a major issue currently.
There is no way to alter terrain like flattening, raising or digging.
Half the time your buildings are clipping through terrain.
Building to make it look good is a massive pain due to the way building from first person is rather slow (especially when the buildings are big).
This really becomes an issue when placing floors/walls.
You constantly have to stack floors on top of each other (and for performance, remove the bottom floor) in order to elevate floors enough to not clip through ground.
For those like me who have OCD lining things up neatly this requires way too much patience and mind you i have quite the patience when it comes to building games.
Also there seems to be a lack of endemic life at the moment, it really needs more for it to feel alive, more diversity in lifeforms as well.
Cannot recommend this until these issues have been addressed.
Some minor issues with being unable to assign tools to hotkeys and placing big buildings from ground level (mainly due to inability to alter terrain).",0,1218,109.1,April 24

5507,"Similar but different to Factorio in all the best ways. The 3D take comes with benefits and disadvantages, but the addictive building qualities are still there. The game is beautiful and runs very well for early access, but the game is early access so there are occassional concerns, but they have been very infrequent and nothing that has ruined game play experience for me thus far.

I'm one of those who found this game and thought it looked interesting but could not understand how it could be a fun premise. You just build a base, right? And then grind through tech trees by making stuff. Yes, but somehow, like Factorio, this game calls to your inner completionist self. Developing your own solution to making an efficient production line is so inviting and addictive, and clearly there are plenty out there who agree based on the player numbers of games like this, Factorio and Dyson Sphere Project (which is now on my short list of games to try next).

It's calming and satisfying at the same time. There are elements that are not smooth and I would like to see improved, such as building in 3rd person to make placement easier, and being able to automate or queue self crafting commands (or create tech to speed it up). And the logistics of belts is either not completely refined, or I may have missed some of the more advanced commands, but again they are still developing the game.

So far, the Dev rollout plan has been slow but methodical, and the updates contain large additions to content, they are hitting all the right ideas to add, so I think this game is on the right track. If it looks interesting, it's probably right up your alley.",1,1381,43.5,April 24

(22 hours in and no remarkable bugs).

base building: I am the person that can only decide on the set up I want after placing it down and deleting it 100 times until it looks and flows just right... this game reduces all the time consuming monotony of breaking down a huge setup just to move it a few meters.

5517,"A most satisfying experience.

First of all, this game is very relaxing. You are not pressured in time, only in ressources that have to be found and exploited. You do it all on your own terms, no pressure for progression but your own. The only danger is the wildlife, but once you get some equipment and get the feel of it, it's not hard to deal with.

Basically, it's all about organization. You don't have to juggle with thermodynamic or fluid mechanics, only with extraction and transformation.

That being said, the game has many production lines who will merge into other production lines to keep you busy redesigning everything to your taste or you just deal with it and watch your conveyor spaghetti mess rise off the ground.

You start with just a miner and, soon enough, end up with a mutli level factory with kilometres of conveyor belts going in every directions. Fun to plan or just wing it.

As of update 4, it feels almost like a finished game: it's stable and has enough quality content to keep you busy for a while.

If you like those kind of games, this one might be a must have. For the pricing, tons of other games fall very short, but this one delivers.

5569,"Satisfactory is a fantastically complex factory builder on the surface that ultimately feels empty and directionless as it fails to actually provide any motivation for building said factories in the first place. It's aimless and meandering, and apparently the reason to build is building itself.

Granted the game is in Early Access (has been for a very long time) and this very likely may change in the future - until then, I am only giving it a negative review because if the game were to stay in it's current state, it wouldn't be a very fulfilling or fun game. It lacks goals.

Progress is basically player driven, and learn things by trying them out yourself. this makes improving in this game feel real and really makes you excited when you learn new techniques to improve automation.

5628,"Note: I hardly ever review games, but this game is great and deserves a review.

This game is absolutely amazing. It's in early access, so there will be bugs. However, so far, I have not discovered a single bug while playing this game. This game runs great, looks amazing, and works extremely well. I cannot recommend this enough. This is one of those games where, even if this type of game isn't for you, you cannot ignore the amount of work put into it. This game is a masterpiece.

What I like:
-------------
Floors can be built inside and overlap each other
Multiple hotbar levels, 10 spots in each level, 10 levels (can have more with upgrades, i think)
Mostly a building game, but the combat and exploration are amazing as well
There's so much in this game. This turns into that which turns into 9 other things which each turn into something else.
Automation go brrrrrr
Ridiculously huge maps to explore
Multiple map types (desert, flats, snow)

What I don't like:
-------------------
nothing. seriously, after sitting here for about 5 minutes thinking about what's wrong with this game, I cannot find a single bad thing about it.

Extremely great game. Never thought I'd enjoy a game like this (I'm a pvp type of guy. Rust, tarkov, ya know, those games).

Building clipping is out of this planet. You can build splitters/mergers inside of buildings, which means you'll be unable to connect belt to them. Belts however, can easily go through each other.
No build assist mode - you play as regular sized human and you place building 3x your height with no way of seeing behind them. This causes you to rebuild 3-4 times before you finally line up input with output properly.

I will put this out at the start of this review, I do enjoy this game whenever I play it, I think that there are a lot of things this game does well and every new update there is a plethora of things to explore and the polish of those features seem pretty decent for an early access game.

With that being said, I cannot recommend this game due to how boring it gets very quickly.

The game has very shallow depth for a game that it wants to be. Sandbox games usually allow you to build on your own level of depth you want the game to have, however the clear lack of tools and building options to do so it comes as no surprise that you can only arrange the same foundations a couple of times till you become bored of doing so. There is only 1 map and no map editor for community to create it's own maps, in my opinion a game like this should natively support some kind of editor tool to allow you to create your own maps, have some kind of expansion past the initial map or generate a random map every game, that way no game feels ever the same. On top of it, the progression system is very linear, with an attempt at creating a tech tree through MAM it still does not give you any options to go past, something I'd like to see is some kind of missions to complete rather than following the same format that milestone system follows.

I know this may came off a bit as harsh, however I really hope I can change this review as the time goes on and wish that the game keeps improving and keeps filling a lot of the void there is in the game.",0,1332,177.5,April 22

There are some user interface bugs (you will need to figure out trucks/truck depots with trial and error, no tutorial or UI hints) but the game play is smooth as butter for early access.

5729,"Satisfactory isn't a game. Satisfactory is an addiction. Of all the crafting games I've played, none have blended enjoyment, management, discovery, and beauty as well as this. Typically, this genre tends to overwhelm with a lack of guidance, and an over reliance on tedium. Satisfactory is vast (probably way more than I'm anticipating having only played for 10 hours at the time of this recommendation) and there are tedious elements, but the systems allow you to go at your own pace. There aren't (to my knowledge) bad guys that come out at night and ruthlessly destroy all you've been working on. Satisfactory is about efficiency, and the continuous nagging thought of ""how can I be manufacturing this stuff quicker and easier? How can I make this automation work for me?"" Yeah. It's a great game, and the complexity of the systems really make you think. There doesn't seem to be a true failure state. Machines don't break down, you don't have to keep your engineer fed or watered, deconstruction of a structure doesn't hurt you or leave you resource-less; it's simply a race against yourself. Maybe this all changes the deeper into the game you get, but after 10 hours, I can't recommend Satisfactory enough. Try it!

Functionally speaking the game is good. It is obviously like factory and if you liked that game but you can stomach a little more chaos, then this a good game for you.

I would not recommend this game at this moment because of sometimes unplayable delay on client side and CONSTANT (every session) crashes, ending with the unreal crash reporter and it necessitating a restart of the PC in most cases. It can even cause other games not to start anymore.

If that does not happen on your system, then great and more power to you. I am sure you will get the price worth of game out of this one. Yet, for me this game left a sour taste in my mouth.

I think it would be bold to hide behind ""early access"" after such a long development time when it comes to such general technical issues, so whether you think this will be better in the future is up to you.",0,810,115.4,April 21
5740,"This game's awesome. The choices you make when designing your factory impact how you'll be interacting with the world and what challenges you'll face moving forward. Many transportation options and building blocks allow you to customize your factory in interesting and expressive ways. This means that even for long-distance operations, you don't necessarily need to use the same solution every time and you can get really creative with how you choose to play. The world is sweet and just keeps going. There are many biomes and the use of verticality and scale is pretty magnificent. The atmosphere of the game is nice, the UI and all the factory blocks are pretty once you get used to the scale of them. The exploration aspect of the game rewards you for looking around while the combat and environmental hazards add stakes to the experience.

You must consent to data collection about you for the game you purchased. For this reason, it deserved to get a negative vote.

Negative features:
1. There is no goal in the game. There is nothing but technological progress and production. In Factorio, you can fight with alien creatures that are constantly getting stronger and spread on the planet and you can have fun by producing different war vehicles.

2. Weapon types are very bad and inadequate.

3.No heavy weapons (tanks, helicopters, planes, artillery)

4. No active server creation. You can only work with an invitation. Don't buy if you dream of big servers. You cannot set up a professional server or connect because it is not available. In short, the game is single player.

5. The map is not unlimited. It will take a very large island limited.

6. Ridiculous: The resources are endless. This is not realistic, just like a children's game. It should have been a game about running out of resources and researching the environment for different resources.

7. The number of scientific researches is extremely low.

8. There are no blueprints for building duplication and setting up huge facilities. You have to do everything one by one or install mods.

9. So:
Factorio = Protein / Satisfactory = Fructose syrup
Factorio = Sun / Satisfactory = Moon
Factorio = Thorium / Satisfactory = Calcium
Factorio = Strong state / Satisfactory = Village

You have a long way to go.

5769,"I love this game, and this is why.

I've spent a lot of my life gaming and this game stands out to me on so many levels. The reason for this, I think, is the wide range of talents of the people responsible for creating it. You can be smart without being particularly talented, you can be talented without being particularly creative, you can be creative without being funny. To be all of those, and have enough empathy, care and insight to place the player in the center, is incredibly rare. This is what this game does, it embodies all of that. You feel it when you play. It's full of jokes, mindboggling landscapes, otherworldly plants, creatures and structures.

So much of the game industry is about tricking players into playing games that aren't that fun. They do it by psychological tricks, by creating habits (offering daily and random rewards, each having their own psychological hook) and sure, they have players. But are the players happy while playing the game? Most producers don't seem to care. The creators of this game do, and it shows. Every gorgeous landscape, every joke, every little treasurehunt is an adventure with the player in focus. The game is created with love and with joy and you can just feel it when you play. You pick one bacon agaric plant next to some mountain and then you see another one, following the trail of baconcrumbs into a cavernous miniadventure. There are hundreds, maybe thousands of these all over the map. It makes me feel like it's the person that is valued, not the purse. I feel like my experience is key to everything the creators put in and I'm not used to that. It's a wonderful feeling.",1,1372,1074.3,April 21

5789,"This game is one of my favorites for sure. The sense of discovery is quite magical; and the pacing and balance of the game feels very rewarding. Plus the lizard doggos are the cutest, not to mention the little factory cart (which is even more silly because it is incredibly hard to drive)!

I find the world charming, the way you are treated by your faceless superiors is comparable to how people are treated in The Outer Worlds. The art is vivid and absolutely gorgeous, especially in the ""easier"" desert. Something i found interesting is that it is just one big map, and picking before you start is simply deciding how much you want to struggle in the beginning/ where you want to be located. If you like Minecraft, you will absolutely adore this game for sure; it scratches a similar itch, but more focused in its goals.

The fauna in this game are interesting to me, i mentioned the ""lizard doggo"" before, but there is also a land whale that walks on stilted legs, and if you step on it, it is bouncy like a jump pad. There are also fire spitting rhinos and boars that headbutt you, as well as fireflies the size of volleyballs, and jumping spiders that can be replaced with cute cat heads, with arachnophobia mode on. There is very little to say negatively about this game to be honest. My only ""problem"" with this game (not really a problem) is that when you are playing multiplayer, if your partner quits, their body just stands there idly wherever they were when they quit; the same thing happens every update too where you respawn and it leaves a random character wherever you were standing when you last saved.

5793,"To say this game is incredibly well-balanced would be a pretty large understatement.

In general, the art style, music, and humor are EXACTLY what I wanted in this masterpiece without having any expectations to begin with. The world feels rich and pulls me to explore even though there's comparatively less content than in many open world games. Sometimes I'll see a resource like 5000m away and make a plan to connect it to my factory just because I know I'll have a lot of fun figuring out how any one of 10 ways I want to do it.

The moment I knew I was hooked was when I was about 15ish hours in and suddenly my power went out while adding to my copper refinery group. Got some fuel for the reserve biomass burners, flipped the switch, then boom, off again? Ohhh, I added too many power draws, let's make a few more burners! But wait, now my factory lost synchronization because the coal going to the hydro generators was being pulled from 2000m away, so now I can't get enough power to run the extractors to get the coal! Let's add a container in-line to store the coal and act as a capacitor for when I get it going again. Meanwhile, I set up 5 burners on a separate circuit to power the coal extractors and some other basic functions, now I need lots of biofuel! That should work! OH WAIT, I'M OUT OF BIOFUEL. Let's go ""borrow"" some alien carapaces to get a quick jump. Ok, got that, split the fuel between the burners, coal is now being pulled in for the hydro generators.

You really have to keep an eye on things, the game is SO engaging and makes you plan ahead as best you can, only to realize every time you add something that you need to re-configure a preexisting group of machines to work better with your modifications, or you need more of a certain resource since you started more advanced production, or you need to travel thousands of meters just to get the one oil resource within a 10min drive, or you need to venture out to find new technology in the wilderness, or any of a hundred other aspects to manage.

Heavy focus on building and automation of manufactured goods.
Very light combat, exploration, narrative and goals.

Seemingly endless possibilities for base expansion and complexity could potentially provide many gameplay hours.

Runs surprisingly well considering all the complex structures that start adding up.

My only concern is lack of content and incentive to build elaborate bases. As with any crafting game, you will eventually question the time investment and tedium.

I think if it had a clear and defined goal and endgame, it would have more staying power. I'm struggling to justify 100s of hours to streamline everything without any kind of payoff.
I just simply can't click for hoyrs on emd without a carrot to chase.

The exploration is fun, resources don't seem too stingy so it's not like you're forced out into a world too quickly. A few unique weapons make the aliens not that difficult but be careful around cliffs. The knockback some have is nasty and can send you flying with a ton of time to think about it before you die. Very fun game once the mechanics start to click. Open world base builder factory stuff and it feels so good to see those items zipping along the belts!

The amount of satisfying progression and the wonderful interpretation of seeing your own factory in action is something that only Tekkit classic could replicate, and Satisfactory excels even beyond that.

5883,"This game is amazing. If you're a fan of open world, survival, crafting, and idle games this game is perfect. One of my biggest issues with this genre of games is inventory management, redundant crafting of older recipes, and continually having to harvest resource. Since the focus of this game is automation mining can be done automatically, crafting can be done automatically, and conveyor belts move the items to a storage contain. You still have to manage your ever expanding personal inventory but it's so much less daunting. The survival aspect isn't overly challenging but if you go too far things will kill you if you don't have decent weapons. Not having my infrastructure damaged by time or monsters is also so nice. I don't want to play a constant repair game. Once you've stabilized power you can treat this game like an idle game and leave it running to continue crafting. To progress in the game you'll need to export the wilds for new resources and it's a really good balance. I really hope future update do not ruin the great balance this game currently has.",1,906,287.5,April 20

At the first try i could walk ingame but not look around. Took some time and several tries to fix the problem via .exe file-properties. So i started a world, built a first factory, then update 4 came. I wasnt surprised to see my save game was gone and i had to start over but the mouse was stuck again. Same problem, the way i fixed it before didnt fix it now, it took 2 evenings of frustration till i got it to work. OK i started a new world, better planned then first time, played some hours, got coal working, then random small update appears... mouse stuck AGAIN... several days later i solved the problem... getting rid of anti virus solved it xD

The thing that surprised me the most and made me felt that most other games lack is an Arachnophobia mode, which prevents me from screaming and throwing my headphones away every single time a spider comes to give me a hug.

I'm not sure if this is something the developers are aware of, but until then I won't be playing anymore. I also lost a save of 50+ hours after the update, not too happy about that either.

I remember the first time I played Command and Conquer and playing all the way through the night. Or that time I was introduced to Civilization and realized one more turn actually lasted till dawn. Since then, I have played a lot of games. I love all types of games.

This game is some other animal. It is strategy, progression and a sense of accomplishment that many games cannot master. It is fun beyond belief. When I saw the trailer, I had no idea how conveyor belts could be exciting. Then the game launches, then you start to play, and then hours of time disappear.

I introduced my friend to this, and he started and now cannot stop as well. We stopped playing Valheim (another great game) since this enter our lives. We played multiplayer, which is a lot of fun to do this game as two.

Look, this is a great game. This is well thought out and so unique. Fantastic and well worth the time and money. The fact that this is not complete adds even more excitement to the coming content of this game and I have barely cracked it.

Having long conveyors from ore nodes to more centralized locations really help, it seems not worth it at first but you only have to build it once. Then you tear it all down and build it better, rinse and repeat. Lots to upgrade and research, huge maps, chill overall. If you like making things efficient, and don't mind flexing your brain a bit this game can be fun. Although you have to be in the mood for it.",1,637,87.7,April 19

Now there is 4 wonderful start area's and tons of fun.

Additionally there's still a lot of content to come and the modding community is great.",1,296,55.5,April 19
6037,"It is stunning to see how far Satisfactory has come over the years. And it will go further.

The game does many things very well.

Building in Satisfactory just WORKS. Everything fits together nicely, which is really great because I get kinda OCD. I have had no small amount of headaches when building in some other games, so it is really a Satisfying experience.

You can tear down everything at no penalty (you get back the full amount of resources you used to build), which is really great when you're experimenting new ideas or just trying to get things in the right position.

And you have full control over the way you want to build your factory; spaghetti, organised, or somewhere in between.

It also gives me a great, yet perhaps slightly strange, sense of pleasure to run around sliding under conveyor belts. IT COMPLETES ME.

------------------------------------------------------------

I love how calming and peaceful the game is because I can chill for hours on end, building my factory and optimising production lines and layouts.
Not having this imminent danger at the back of my head that hordes of creatures are approaching to destroy my hard work.

Yet, that doesn't mean there isn't any combat. In fact, conflict with the fauna (and flora...?) can get rather intense while you're out and about. Rest assured, there are really neat weapons and equipment.

Exploring is also a huge part of the game, which is why it's so awesome to have a breathtaking world with many biomes to be in awe of while exploring the expansive map (30 square kilometres).

------------------------------------------------------------

Side progression content, like research trees, adds more layers to an already immensely deep game.
I'm always unlocking new stuff, like parts that can be used to make my factory look even cleaner and more Satisfying.

I really appreciate the details in the game as well.
The animations are so magnificent (like the Space Elevator's, for one) and the sound effects are very fitting.
Building and item designs look great and the music is very relaxing.

You can't really see your own character at this point, especially in single player, but I know a lot of work has gone into the character design and I wish we could appreciate it more.

------------------------------------------------------------

There's a whole ton of content and features yet to come, and bugs to be fixed, but Coffee Stain is passionately working on the game.

They are such a chill group of devs, and I love watching their Youtube channel because you can see how real they are, and learn about how they make the game (especially from the Developer Highlights).
It is also rare to see Community Managers that are as engaged as Jace and Snutt are.

Game initially has a very ARK and Subnautica feel to it - you're on your own (you against the world), running around and slowly grabbing every resource you can by hand. Then you start unlocking various tiers of tools and mechanisms to upscale and automate this process to be able to unlock further tiers with better tools and mechanisms, Graphics are beautiful. The game doesn't hold your hand and doesn't spoonfeed you how to build your factory - during tutorial you are taught the basics of how to use your tools and how to gather resources, the rest is up to you. That means if you don't start building your factory lines as soon as you receive the blueprints, you'll be running around for an hour forth and back manually gathering resources and processing them by hand, all the while thinking to yourself: ""there's gotta be a faster way of doing this"" - the game is called ""Satisfactory"" ... you're suppose to build automated lines not fetch everything by hand. However, if you don't like building factories or tweaking your conveyor lines... you might not enjoy this. There's a research table, which allows you to unlock stuff through exploration and research by feeding research projects components like alien animals and various plants but overall the exploration feels rather limited, because again, this is ""Satisfactory"" and not ""Exploratory"".",1,1180,3.5,April 19

6093,"I saw some complaints regarding the multiplayer connectivity on this game that I want to address before the rest of my review, for those of you who only enjoy this kind of game with friends:

Although I have only played 3 relatively short sessions with the same person so far, I can report that the only bugs/issues encountered on either side were general desync, such as the joiner initially having bushes/trees that appear harvest-able but are no longer on the map for the host. This however resolved itself quickly upon leaving the vicinity of the 'ghost assets' and returning, which removes those assets. Apart from this, the joiner will find it slightly more difficult to hit enemies due to split-second delays in attacks compared to the host. Bearing in mind that the devs have a disclaimer on the Multiplayer saying that it is buggier than Solo, I would say that the online is functioning very well. (My issues were observed on a long distance connection between Eastern US and Southern Africa)

Moving on to the rest of the game, this is a real gem. I've spent just as much time crafting, building, optimising and completing missions as I have spent exploring, admiring the scenery and watching my machinery and production lines work. This game is not only entertaining and well developed, but also just plain satisfying, as the name itself implies (as well as the endless ""this game is Satisfactory"" jokes I've made to my partner).

There is never any time pressure. Its up to you what you want to do and when you want to do it. Even the how is almost 100% up to you and your vision.

To go into detail would make this review way too long. If you are at all interested in the concepts of Industry & Production and building fabrication plants exactly the way you want, get this game without hesitation.",1,1515,55.7,April 19

6099,"Satisfactory Review

This is a great game! I really enjoy it, the tutorial is very easy to follow which is nice.
When you progress in the game, it becomes harder every tier you go up and you really have to plan your factory.

There are a few things that I personally would like to see in the future like:
- Maintenance on buildings
- Random mob spawns (they now spawn in fixed places)
- Make it so mobs can actually do damage to your buildings
- Probably some more but can't think of any right now

I really have a lot of stutters (1-3 seconds) while having 90+fps. That is really frustating, but the game is still in early acces so that will probably be fixed in the future.",1,573,43.4,April 19

6109,"If you have played factorio this is like the 3D version.
More focus on exploration and complex multi level factories. You can build extremly complex factories with great organization. The optimization is incredible, even as your factory grows the frames dont seem to change.
Not for everyone but if you like building things and making things work automonosly then this game is for you.
The graphics are beautiful.",1,367,29.6,April 19

....Satisfactory.

my only complaint is this feels like it'd be fun with a bit of Randomly generated maps, who knows, maybe in the future.",1,171,477.2,April 19
6117,Very captivating. If you are trying to grind out a resource there is always something else to do. Fun to try to figure out the most efficient way to make things,1,148,18.3,April 19
6118,"One might say this game is... satisfactory! Plays like one of those ""oddly satisfying"" videos, except you're the one executing the satisfaction. I love that I can play it idly while taking care of my son, then really get into it when he's asleep. 10/10.",1,227,50.3,April 19
6119,"So I think it's only fair that I revisit this since I have since put in another 90 hours since my first review (and I think I'm addicted). I must admit I judged too soon and I have left my original review up for reference. If you want the short answer, yes I think it's worth the purchase but read on for why.

My original problem turned out to be my own failures. The game is not easy, in fact I would say it suffers from a classic pitfall in this type of game: the learning cliff. But that said I wouldn't change it, because I hate games that hold your hand too much. In fact in retrospect this game does a great job to hold your hand just enough to not be annoying on additional playthroughs yet still let you fail by your own stupidity.

Designing a production line is frustrating, complicated, and yet amazingly rewarding process. (prepare to ask ""where did the last 4 hours go""?). Unlocking new toys is fun as hell! Realizing you unlocked something amazing and can't build it until you go find a bunch of new stuff is super annoying (in that I get to go search for stuff and die trying way), but wait there's more!

Being chased by scary ass giant freaking spiders will probably induce nightmares (there's an arachnophobe mode which changes the sprites, thanks devs but I like my adrenaline injections)! You will learn the sounds of some mobs and reflexively jump to avoid their attack. Oh and even though it doesn't kill stuff there is no end to the fun of running over above mentioned mobs with your dune buggy thing. Yes I have parked the vehicle on top of them to keep them from attacking me, this is a viable tactic.

Ultimately I would say buy the game if you have $25 to spend (at time of writing) and love these types of crafting exploring games. But do be aware that there are bugs, some of them can be fun, others annoying. However I haven't seen a truly game breaking bug yet, so for early access at this price point it's a great game so far.

P.S. If you're like me and struggling, go find the wiki and an online map to help you out. It may feel a bit like cheating but even on my second play through I am finding the wiki very helpful!


Original Review:

Honestly I wanted to love this game. And on a level I do love it, which is why it pains me to say no right now. Ultimately I love this type of builder game, I loved Factorio for example, however I hated resource depletion in that game. I had thought maybe this game turned it into 3d and ditched that, which it did. BUT, the problem is power generation. There are no other depletion mechanics but after a short period I found myself constantly maintaining power generators. I want to love this game, and on a level I do, but I also want this game to be more of a sandbox than it is. It is for this reason that I at this moment I can't so solidly ""yes buy it"". I do hope given the early access status that the game will catch up.",1,2374,171.3,April 18

6148,"TLDR: A generally chill, graphics card breaking, factory builder on a beautiful alien world with satisfyingly tight mechanics and, that is kind of it?

LONGER: It is a 3D factory builder which has put a heavy emphasis on logistics and exploitation of resources, a secondary emphasis on exploration and a nearly non-existent emphasis on combat. Do not expect a factorio style alien assault. That being said, what it does choose to focus on, is executed superbly. Controls for building are straight forward enough, logistics setup seems fairly intuitive and the research aspect really gets you out there to explore a very beautiful and fairly varied alien landscape. The music is pretty damn good as well.

That being said, the games requirements can totally place a choke hold on your PC, depending on your settings and the combat is very rudimentary. Its very clear that it was never really the focus but, generally speaking it does not feel great so, if you are here for combat for some reason, this one wont do it for you. Its more of a grim necessity than something to revel in.

Overall, have a chill time, build some factories and, plow a wonderful natural wonder of a world into a concrete jungle of most efficient resource exploitation!",1,1053,102.9,April 18

I died three times completing the very first objective. Why? The markers were WAY off from the objective and were underground. I had to go watch a video of the game to figure out what the hell to do. (The markers felt entirely uncorrelated with the objective.) Instead of refunding the game as I should have, I persisted -- seemingly because I wanted to encounter the same or similar issues ad infinitum. For people interested in having any clue as to what they should do next, this game is best described as a bookmark-the-Wiki simulator.

You advance the game by finding new items in the world. The most recent two items I found are ""WIP"" and explicitly state they don't do anything.
